It is legitimate to construe the Code with reference to the modern needs, wherever this is permissible, unless there is anything in the Code or in any particular section to indicate the contrary.2."

      "title": "Punishment of offences committed within India.",
      "content": "Every person 1 shall be liable to punishment under this Code and not otherwise for every act or omission contrary to the provisions thereof, of which he shall be guilty within 11.[India] 12.[***]. 2\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section deals with the intraterritorial operation of the Code. It makes the Code universal in its application to every person in any part of India for every act or omission contrary to the provisions of the Code.\nSection 2 read with section 4 of the IPC, 1860 makes the provisions of the Code applicable to the offences committed \"in any place without and beyond\" the territory of India; (1) by a citizen of India or (2) on any ship or aircraft registered in India, irrespective of its location, by any person not necessarily a citizen. Such a declaration was made as long back as in 1898. By an amendment in 2009 to the said section, the Code is extended to any person in any place \"without and beyond the territory of India\", committing an offence targeting a computer resource located in India.13.\n1. 'Every person'.—Every person is made liable to punishment, without distinction of nation, rank, caste or creed, provided the offence with which he is charged has been committed in some part of India. A foreigner who enters the Indian territories and thus, accepts the protection of Indian laws virtually gives an assurance of his fidelity and obedience to them and submits himself to their operation. It is no defence on behalf of a foreigner that he did not know he was doing wrong, the act not being an offence in his own country. A foreigner who commits an offence within India is guilty and can be\n\npunished as such without any limitation as to his corporal presence in India at the time.14. Indian Courts have jurisdiction against foreigners residing in foreign countries but their acts connected with transaction or part of transaction arising in India.15."

      "title": "Corporate Criminal Liability",
      "content": "A company is liable to be prosecuted and punished for criminal offences. Although there are earlier authorities to the fact that the corporation cannot commit a crime, the generally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and other criminal process although the criminal act may be committed through its agent. The majority in the Constitution bench held that there is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the punishment is mandatory imprisonment and fine.16. When imprisonment and fine is prescribed as punishment the Court can impose the punishment of fine which could be enforced against the company.17.\n\nIn CBI v Blue Sky Tie-up Pvt Ltd,18. the question again came up for consideration before the Supreme Court and it was held that since the majority of the Constitution Bench ruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement [supra] that the company can be prosecuted even in a case where the Court can impose substantive sentence as also fine, and in such case only fine can be imposed on the corporate body, the contrary view taken by the learned single Judge cannot be approved."

    "section2.2": {
      "title": "Vicarious Liability.—",
      "content": "Indian Penal Code, save and except some matters does not contemplate any vicarious liability on the part of a person. Commission of an offence by raising a legal fiction or by creating a vicarious liability in terms of the provisions of a statute must be expressly stated. The Managing Director or the Directors of the Company, thus, cannot be said to have committed an offence only because they are holders of offices.19. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision fixing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.20. The provisions of the Essential Commodities Act, 1955, Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, Employees' Provident Fund (Miscellaneous Provision) Act, 1952, etc., have created such vicarious liability. It is interesting to note that section 14A of the 1952 Act specifically creates an offence of criminal breach of trust in respect of the amount deducted from the employees by the company. In terms of the explanations appended to section 405 of the IPC, 1860 a legal fiction has been created to the effect that the employer shall be deemed to have committed an offence of criminal breach of trust. Whereas a person in charge of the affairs of the company and in control thereof has been made vicariously liable for the offence committed by the company along with the company but even in a case falling under section 406 of the IPC, 1860 vicarious liability has been held to be not extendable to the Directors or officers of the company.21.\nThere is no exception in favour of anyone in the Penal Code, but the following persons are exempted from the jurisdiction of criminal Courts of every country:—\n(a) Foreign Sovereigns.—The real principle on which the exemption, of every sovereign from the jurisdiction of every Court, has been deduced is that the exercise of such jurisdiction would be incompatible with his regal dignity—that is to say, with his absolute independence of every superior authority.22.\n\n(b) Diplomats.—United Nations Privileges and Immunities Act, 1947, and the Diplomatic Relations (Vienna Convention) Act, 1972, gave certain diplomats, missions and their member's diplomatic immunity even from criminal jurisdiction. The Diplomatic Relations (Vienna Convention) Act had been enacted to give effect to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, 1961. The effect of section 2 of the Act is to give the force of law in India to certain provisions set out in the Schedule to the Act.\nA diplomatic agent shall enjoy immunity from the criminal jurisdiction of the receiving State. He shall also enjoy immunity from its civil and administrative jurisdiction except in the case of:\n\n(i) A real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the receiving State, unless he holds it on behalf of the sending State for the purposes of the mission;\n(ii) An action relating to succession in which the diplomatic agent is involved as executor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of the sending State;\n(iii) An action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the diplomatic agent in the receiving State outside his official functions.23. A diplomatic agent is not obliged to give evidence as a witness.24. Privileges and immunities are conferred on United Nations and its Representatives as well as on other international organisations and their representatives by the United Nations (Privileges and Immunities) Act, 1947.25.\n(c) Alien enemies.—In respect of acts of war alien enemies cannot be tried by criminal Courts. If an alien enemy commits a crime unconnected with war, e.g., theft, he would be triable by ordinary criminal Courts.\n(d) Foreign army.—When armies of one State are by consent on the soil of a foreign State they are exempted from the jurisdiction of the State on whose soil they are.\n(e) Warships.—Men-of-war of a State in foreign waters are exempt from the jurisdiction of the State within whose territorial jurisdiction they are. The domestic Courts, in accordance with principles of international law, will accord to the ship and its crew and its contents certain immunities. The immunities can, in any case, be waived by the nation to which the public ship belongs.26.\n(f) President and Governors.—Under Article 361 of the Indian Constitution, the President and Governors are exempt from the jurisdiction of Courts.\n2. 'Within India'.—If the offence is committed outside India it is not punishable under the Penal Code, unless it has been made so by means of special provisions such as sections 3, 4, 108A, etc., of the Code. Under section179 of the Cr PC, 1973 even the place(s) wherein the consequence (of the criminal act) \"ensues\" would be relevant to determine the Court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, even the Courts within whose local jurisdiction, the repercussion/effect of the criminal act occurs, would have jurisdiction in the matter. When the consequence of an act committed by a foreigner outside India if ensued in India, he can be tried in India.27. Normally crime carries the person. The commission of a crime gives the Court of the place where it is committed jurisdiction over the person of the offender.28."

      "title": "Territorial jurisdiction.—",
      "content": "The territory of India is defined under Article 1 of the Constitution of India. Article 1 of the Constitution of India deals only with the geographical territory while Article 297 deals with 'maritime territory'.\nArticle 297(3) authorises the Parliament to specify from time to time the limits of various maritime zones such as, territorial waters, continental shelf, etc. Clauses (1) and (2) of the said Article make a declaration that all lands, minerals and other things of value and all other resources shall vest in the Union of India.29. Section 18 of the IPC, 1860 defines India as the territory of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir. These territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.30. Under the General Clauses Act, 1897, India is defined to mean all territories for the time being comprised in the territory of India as defined in the Constitution of India. Under the provisions of Article 297 of the Constitution of India, all lands, minerals and other things of value underlying the ocean within the territorial waters or the continental shelf or the exclusive economic zone of India vest in the Union. The Constitution of India does not itself define the terms territorial waters, continental shelf, and exclusive economic zone. Clause (3) of Article 297 states that their limits shall be such as may be specified by Parliament. In 1976, Parliament implemented the amendments to the Constitution of India by passing the Maritime Zones Act, 1976.31. Insofar the Republic of India is concerned, the limit of the territorial waters was initially understood to be three nautical miles. It had been extended subsequently; up to six nautical miles by a Presidential proclamation dated 22 March 1952 and to 12 nautical miles by another proclamation dated 30 September 1967. By The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 80 of 1976, it was statutorily fixed at 12 nautical miles. Section 3 of the Act stipulates that the sovereignty of India extends to the territorial waters, the limit of which is 12 nautical miles. Section 5 of the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 defines the contiguous zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent to territorial waters to a distance of 24 nautical miles from the nearest point of the baseline. Section 7 of the Act defines the Exclusive economic zone of India as an area beyond and adjacent to territorial waters up to a limit of 200 nautical miles.32."

      "title": "Jurisdiction beyond Territorial Waters",
      "content": "In the case of British India Steam Navigation Co Ltd v Shanmughavilas Cashew Industries,33. the Supreme Court examined the effective operation of the statutes of a country in relation to foreigners and foreign ships.\nIn general, a statute extends territorially, unless the contrary is stated, throughout the country and will extend to the territorial waters, and such places as intention to that effect is shown. A statute extends to all persons within the country if that intention is shown. The Indian Parliament, therefore, has no authority to legislate for foreign vessels or foreigners in them on the high seas. Thus a foreign ship on the high seas, or her foreign owners or their agents in a foreign country, are not deprived of rights by our statutory enactment expressed in general terms unless it provides that a foreign ship entering an Indian port or territorial waters and thus coming within the territorial jurisdiction is to be covered. Without anything more Indian statutes are ineffective against foreign property and foreigners outside the jurisdiction.\n\nIt is this principle which is reflected in section 2(2) of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958.34.\nEarlier in Aban Loyd Chiles Offshore Ltd v UOI,35. it was held that India has been given only certain limited sovereign rights and such limited sovereign rights conferred on India in respect of continental shelf and exclusive economic zone cannot be equated to extending the sovereignty of India over the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone as in the case of territorial waters.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The Code applies to any offence committed by—\n\n(1) any citizen of India in any place, wherever he may be;\n(2) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be; and\n(3) any person, whether or not a citizen of India, who commits any offence, from anywhere in the world, targeting a computer resource located in India.\nHence, except for the case of an offence committed against a computer resource located in India, to extend the scope of operation of IPC, 1860 against persons, either the offender must be a citizen of India or he must have committed the offence on any ship or aircraft registered in India."

      "title": "Crimes committed outside India.—",
      "content": "Where an offence is committed beyond the limits of India but the offender is found within its limits, then\n\n(I) he may be given up for trial in the country where the offence was committed (extradition) or\n(II) he may be tried in India (extraterritorial jurisdiction).\n\nWhere an offence was committed by an Indian citizen outside India, it was held that the offence was punishable under the IPC, 1860. An investigation of such an offence would not require sanction of the Central Government under the proviso to section 188, Cr PC, 1973. But an enquiry as contemplated by section 202, Cr PC, 1973 could only be with the sanction of the Central Government.55.\n(I) Extradition.—Extradition is the surrender by one State to another of a person desired to be dealt with for crimes of which he has been accused or convicted and which are justiciable in the Courts of the other State. Surrender of a person within the State to another State—whether a citizen or an alien—is a political act done in pursuance of a treaty or an arrangement ad hoc.56. Though extradition is granted in implementation of the international commitment of the State, the procedure to be followed by the Courts in deciding, whether extradition should be granted and on what terms, is determined by the municipal law of the land. Extradition is founded on the broad principle that it is in the interest of civilised communities that criminals should not go unpunished and on that account, it is recognised as a part of the comity of nations that one State should ordinarily afford to another State assistance towards bringing offenders to justice.57. The procedure for securing the extradition from India is laid down in the Extradition Act, 1962.\n(II) Extraterritorial jurisdiction.—Indian Courts are empowered to try offences committed out of India on (A) land, (B) high seas or (C) aircraft.\n(A) Land.—By virtue of sections 3 and 4 of the Penal Code, and section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973 local Courts can take cognizance of offences committed beyond the territories of India. Where the Court is dealing with an act committed outside India by a citizen of India which would be an offence punishable under the Penal Code if it had been committed in India, section 4 constitutes the act an offence and it can be dealt with under section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973.58. If, however, at the time of commission of\n\nthe offence the accused person is not a citizen of India, the provisions of section 4 of the Penal Code and section 188 of the Cr PC, 1973 have no application.59.\nSection 188 of the Cr PC, 1973, provides that when an offence is committed outside India—\n\n(a) by a citizen of India, whether on high seas or elsewhere; or\n(b) by any person not being such citizen on any ship or aircraft registered in India, he may be dealt with in respect of such offence as if it had been committed at any place within India at which he may be found.\nThe word 'found' in section 188, Cr PC, 1973 means not where a person is discovered but where he is actually present.60. A man brought to a place against his will can be said to be found there.61. When a man is in the country and is charged before a Magistrate with an offence under the Penal Code, it will not avail him to say that he was brought there illegally from a foreign country. The Bombay High Court has laid down this principle, following English precedents, in Savarkar's case.62. The accused Savarkar had escaped at Mareseilles from the custody of police officers charged with the duty of bringing him from London to Bombay, but was re-arrested there and brought to Bombay and committed for trial by the Special Magistrate at Nasik. The High Court held that the trial and committal were valid.63. The provisions of the IPC, 1860 have been extended to offences committed by any citizen of India in any place within and beyond India by virtue of section 4 thereof. Accordingly, offences committed in Botswana by an Indian citizen would also be amenable to the provisions of the IPC, 1860 subject to the limitation imposed under the proviso to section 188 Cr PC, 1973.64. Section 4 gives extraterritorial jurisdiction but as the Explanation says the acts committed must amount to an offence under the Penal Code.65."

      "title": "Acts done within Indian as well as foreign territory.—",
      "content": "A person who is a citizen of India is liable to be tried by the Courts of this country for acts done by him, partly within and partly without the Indian territories, provided the acts amount together to an offence under the Code.66.\n(B) Admiralty jurisdiction.—The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas is known as the admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the high seas is a floating island belonging to the nation whose flag she is flying.\nAdmiralty jurisdiction extends over—\n\n(1) Offences committed on Indian ships on the high seas.\n(2) Offences committed on foreign ships in Indian territorial waters.\n(3) Piracy.\n\nPower to enforce claims against foreign ships is an essential attribute of admiralty jurisdiction and it is assumed over such ships while they are within the jurisdiction of the High Court by arresting and detaining them. Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Courts in India has been historically traced to the Charters of 1774 and 1728, as subsequently expanded and clarified by the Letters Patent of 1823, 1862 and 1865 read with the Admiralty Court Act, 1861, the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890, and the Colonial Court of Admiralty (India) Act, 1891 and preserved by section 106 of the Government of India Act, 1915, section 223 of the Government of India Act, 1935 and\n\nArticle 225 of the Constitution of India. The pre-Constitution enactments have continued to remain in force in India as existing laws.67.\nThe High Court as a Court of Admiralty is treated as a separate entity exercising a distinct and specific or prescribed or limited jurisdiction. This reasoning is based on the assumption that the continuance in force of the Colonial Courts of Admiralty Act, 1890 as an existing law carves out a distinct jurisdiction of the High Court limited in ambit and efficacy to what has been granted by the Admiralty Court Act 1861, and that jurisdiction has remained stultified ever since. This restrictive construction is not warranted by the provisions of the Constitution. Accordingly, a foreign ship falls within the jurisdiction of the High Court where the vessel happens to be at the relevant time, i.e., at the time when the jurisdiction of the High Court is invoked, or, where the cause of action wholly or in part arises. The Merchant Shipping Act empowers the concerned High Court to arrest a ship in respect of a substantive right. This jurisdiction can be assumed by the concerned High Court, whether or not the defendant resides or carries on business, or the cause of action arose wholly or in part, within the local limits of its jurisdiction. Once a foreign ship is arrested within the local limits of the jurisdiction of the High Court, and the owner of the ship has entered appearance and furnished security to the satisfaction of the High Court for the release of the ship, the proceedings continue as a personal action. The conclusion is that all the High Courts in India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction and can invoke the same for the enforcement of a maritime claim.68.\nEven while exercising extraordinary powers available under the Constitution the jurisdiction of the High Court is primarily circumscribed by its territorial limits, viz., the jurisdiction has to be in context of the territorial jurisdiction available to the High Court. If the overall scheme of IPC, 1860 (section 4), Cr PC, 1973 (section 188), The Merchant Shipping Act, 1958 (section 437) and the Territorial Waters Act, 1976 (section 13) are taken into consideration read with sections 2(2) and 3(15) of the Merchant Shipping Act, it is apparent that for a Court, including High Court, to be vested with jurisdiction, an offender or offending vessel have to be found within local territorial limits of such Court.69."

      "title": "Piracy",
      "content": "Piracy consists of any of the following acts:\n\n(a) any illegal acts of violence or detention, or any act of depredation, committed for private ends by the crew or the passengers of a private ship or a private aircraft, and directed:\n(i) on the high seas, against another ship or aircraft, or against persons or property on board such ship or aircraft;\n(ii) against a ship, aircraft, persons or property in a place outside the jurisdiction of any State;\n(b) any act of voluntary participation in the operation of a ship or of an aircraft with knowledge of facts making it a pirate ship or aircraft;\n(c) any act of inciting or of intentionally facilitating an act described in subparagraph (a) or (b).70.\nThe Convention on the Law of Sea known as United National Convention on the Law of Sea, 1982 (UNCLOS) sets out the legal framework applicable to combating piracy and armed robbery at sea, as well as other ocean activities. UNCLOS, 1982 is a\n\ncomprehensive code on the international law of sea. It codifies and consolidates the traditional law within a single, unificatory legal framework. It has changed the legal concept of continental shelf and also introduced a new maritime zone known as exclusive economic zone. Exclusive economic zone is a new concept having several new features.71. The UNCLOS signed by India in 1982 and ratified on 29 June 1995, encapsulates the law of the sea and is supplemented by several subsequent resolutions adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations.\nBefore UNCLOS came into existence, the law relating to the seas which was in operation in India, was the Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act, 1976, which spelt out the jurisdiction of the Central Government over the Territorial Waters, the Contiguous Zones and the Exclusive Economic Zone. The provisions of the UNCLOS are in harmony with and not in conflict with the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, in this regard. Article 33 of the Convention recognises and describes the Contiguous Zone of a nation to extend to 24 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. Similarly, Articles 56 and 57 describe the rights, jurisdiction and duties of the coastal State in the Exclusive Economic Zone and the breadth thereof extending to 20 nautical miles from the baseline from which the breadth of the territorial sea is measured. This provision is also in consonance with the provisions of the 1976 Act. The area of difference between the provisions of the Maritime Zones Act, 1976, and the Convention occurs in Article 97 of the Convention which relates to the penal jurisdiction in matters of collision or any other incident of navigation.72."

The draft underwent further revision at the hands of well-known jurists, like Sir Barnes Peacock, and was completed in 1850. The Indian Penal Code was passed by the then Legislature on 6 October 1860 and was enacted as Act No. XLV of 1860.\n\nPreamble.\tWHEREAS it is expedient to provide a general Penal Code for India; It is enacted as follows:—\nCOMMENT.—The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) exhaustively codifies the law relating to offences with which it deals and the rules of the common law cannot be resorted to for inventing exemptions which are not expressly enacted.1. It is not necessary and indeed not permissible to construe the IPC, 1860 at the present day in accordance with the notions of criminal jurisdiction prevailing at the time when the Code was enacted. The notions relating to this matter have very considerably changed between then and now during nearly a century that has elapsed. It is legitimate to construe the Code with reference to the modern needs, wherever this is permissible, unless there is anything in the Code or in any particular section to indicate the contrary.2.\n\n77.[[s 5] Certain laws not to be affected by this Act.\n\nNothing in this Act shall affect the provisions of any Act for punishing mutiny and desertion of oﬃcers, soldiers, sailors or airmen in the service of the Government of India or the provisions of any special or local law 1 .]\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section is a saving clause to section 2. Though the Code was intended to be a general one, it was not thought desirable to make it exhaustive, and hence, offences defined by local and special laws were left out of the Code, and merely declared to be punishable as theretofore.78. Thus, the personnel of the Army, Navy and Airforce are governed by the provisions of the Army Act, 1950, The Navy Act, 1957, and The Indian Air Force Act, 1950 in regard to offences of mutiny and desertion committed by them.79.\n1. 'Special or local law'.—A special law is a law relating to a particular subject;80. whereas a local law is a law which applies only to a particular part of the country.81. The distinction between a statute creating a new offence with a particular penalty and a statute enlarging the ambit of an existing offence by including new acts within it with a particular penalty is well settled. In the former case the new offence is punishable by the new penalty only; in the latter it is punishable also by all such penalties as were applicable before the Act to the offence in which it is included. The Principle is that where a new offence is created and the particular manner in which proceedings should be taken is laid down, then proceedings cannot be taken in any other way.82. However, a person cannot be punished under both the Penal Code and a special law for the same\n\noffence,83. and ordinarily the sentence should be under the special Act.84. This is, however, confined to cases where the offences are coincident or practically so.85.\nThe Supreme Court issued specific guidelines regarding the interpretation of general law and special law. See the Box below for these Guidelines.\nSupreme Court Guidelines on Interpretation of General law and Special law\n\n(i) When a provision of law regulates a particular subject and a subsequent law contains a provision regulating the same subject, there is no presumption that the later law repeals the earlier law. The rule-making authority while making the later rule is deemed to know the existing law on the subject. If the subsequent law does not repeal the earlier rule, there can be no presumption of an intention to repeal the earlier rule;\n(ii) When two provisions of law — one being a general law and the other being special law govern a matter, the court should endeavour to apply a harmonious construction to the said provisions. But where the intention of the rule-making authority is made clear either expressly or impliedly, as to which law should prevail, the same shall be given effect.\n(iii) If the repugnancy or inconsistency subsists in spite of an effort to read them harmoniously, the prior special law is not presumed to be repealed by the later general law. The prior special law will continue to apply and prevail in spite of the subsequent general law. But where a clear intention to make a rule of universal application by superseding the earlier special law is evident from the later general law, then the later general law, will prevail over the prior special law.\n(iv) Where a later special law is repugnant to or inconsistent with an earlier general law, the later special law will prevail over the earlier general law.\n\n[Maya Mathew v State of Kerala86. and P Raghava Kurup v V Ananthakumari87..]"

      "content": "Contempt of Courts Act, 1971 (Act 70 of 1971) makes it clear that, Contempt of Court means 'Civil contempt' or 'Criminal contempt'.88. 'Civil contempt' means wilful disobedience to any judgment, decree, direction, order, writ or other process of a Court or wilful breach of an Undertaking given to a Court.89. \"Criminal contempt\" means the publication (whether by words, spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representations, or otherwise) of any matter or the doing of any other act whatsoever which – (i) scandalises or tends to scandalise or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any Court; or (ii) prejudices, or interferes or tends to interfere with, the due course of any judicial proceeding; or (iii) interferes or tends to interfere with, or obstructs or tends to obstruct, the administration of justice in any other manner.90. The provisions of this Act shall be in addition to and not in derogation of, the provisions of any other law relating to contempt of Courts.91. Contempt proceeding is sui generis (of its own kind or class or unique). It has peculiar features which are not found in criminal proceedings. The respondent does not stand in the position of a person accused of an offence. Initiation of contempt proceedings against the respondent who is already accused in a criminal proceedings, does not amount to double jeopardy.92. Mens rea is not necessary for committing contempt of Court. The main ingredient of the offence of contempt of Court is the result of one's contumacious act of offending the prestige and dignity of the judiciary so as to lower it in the estimation of the general public. Whether the contemnor intended it or not is of no consequence.93."

The procedure prescribed either under the Cr PC, 1973 or under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 is not attracted to the proceedings initiated under section 15 of the Contempt of Courts Act. The High Court can deal with such matters summarily and adopt its own procedure.

Here A is not guilty of the offence of wrongful confinement; for he was bound by law to apprehend Z and therefore the case falls within the general exception which provides that \"nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is bound by law to do it\".\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of the definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lies on the accused.1.\nSection 6 is a convenient formula to avoid reproduction of lengthy exceptions in the description of offences. In other words, all the offences must be read subject to Chapter IV relating to General Exceptions (sections. 76–106 IPC, 1860). So when an act falls within any one of these exceptions by virtue of section 6 of the Code, the accused has to be given benefit of the appropriate General Exception even though it is not specifically stated over again in the description of the offence committed.2. Section 6 of the Indian Penal Code imposes an obligation on the court to consider the case of exceptions on its own so far as it relates to the burden of proving legal insanity under section 106 of the Act. If the case of the accused comes within the purview of section 84 IPC, 1860, which is one of the provisions in Chapter IV of the General Exceptions of\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

A natural person, an incorporated person or even an unincorporated association or body of persons like a partnership can be a person under section 11 of IPC, 1860.10. The Supreme Court has held in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement,11. that, as regards corporate criminal liability, there is no doubt that a corporation or company could be prosecuted for any offence punishable under law, whether it is coming under the strict liability or under absolute liability. A juristic person has been held to come within the meaning of the word \"person\" for the purposes of section 415 (cheating).12.\nThe State and its instrumentalities are juristic persons,13. but by implication, the State stands excluded from the purview of the word 'person' for the purpose of limiting its right to avail the revisional power of the High Court under section 397(1) of Cr PC, 1973 for the reason that the State, being the prosecutor of the offender, is enjoined to conduct prosecution on behalf of the society and to take such remedial steps as to deems proper.14.

It is not necessary that there should be master and servant relationship to constitute a person as a \"public servant\".

Each category is different from the other and in some of the categories there is hardly any relationship of master and servant.

      "content": "The words \"movable property\" are intended to include corporeal property 1 of every description, except land and things attached to the earth 2 or permanently fastened to anything which is attached to the earth.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis definition is restricted to corporeal property; it excludes all choices in action. The definition of \"movable property\" in the section is not exhaustive.99. The definition of \"movable property\" given in the Indian Penal Code is basically meant for the provisions contained in the Indian Penal Code itself (section 125 Cr PC, 1973).100.\n1. 'Corporeal property' is property which may be perceived by the senses, in contradistinction to incorporeal rights, which are not so perceivable, as obligations of all kinds. Thus, salt produced on a swamp,101. and papers forming part of the record of a case,102. are movable property within the meaning of this section. Even if an assessment order is not 'property' in the hands of the Income-tax Officer, it is 'property' in the hands of the assessee (section 420 IPC, 1860).103.\n2. 'Land and things attached to the earth'.—This section does not exempt \"earth and things attached to the earth\", but \"land and things attached to the earth\"; \"land\" and \"earth\" are not synonymous terms, and there is a great distinction between \"the earth\", and \"earth\". By severance, things that are immovable become movable; and it is perfectly correct to call those things attached which can be severed; and undoubtedly it is possible to sever earth from the earth and attach it again thereto. Earth, that is soil, and all the component parts of the soil, inclusive of stones and minerals, when severed from the earth or land to which it was attached, are movable property capable of being the subject of theft.104. Any part of \"the earth\", whether it is stones or sand or clay or any other component, when severed from \"the earth\", is movable property.105. Standing crop, so long as it is attached to the earth is not movable property as defined in the Code, but the moment it is severed from the earth its character is changed and it can become the subject of theft.106.\nFish in any water are corporeal property and they become subject of theft as soon as they are separated from the waters, dead or alive, and are moved.107.\n\n99.

A person is said to lose wrongfully when such person is wrongfully kept out of any property,1 as well as when such person is wrongfully deprived of property.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe word 'wrongful' means prejudicially affecting a party in some legal right. For either wrongful loss or gain, the property must be lost to the owner, or the owner must be wrongfully kept out of it. Thus, where a pledgee used a turban that was pledged, it was held that the deterioration of the turban by use was not 'wrongful loss' of property to the owner, and the wrongful beneficial use of it by the pledgee was not a 'wrongful gain' to him.108. The gain or loss contemplated need not be a total acquisition or a total deprivation but it is enough if it is a temporary retention of property by the person wrongfully gaining or a temporary \"keeping out\" of property from the person legally entitled.109. Forcible and illegal seizure of bullocks of a widow in satisfaction of a debt due to the accused by her deceased husband was held to be a 'wrongful loss'.110. Where a person, who purchased rice from a famine relief officer, at a certain rate on condition that he should sell it at a pound the rupee less, did not sell it at the rate agreed upon, but at four pounds the rupee less, it was held that no wrongful gain or wrongful loss had been caused to anyone within the meaning of this section. The rice having been sold to the accused, and he having paid for it, it was not unlawful for him to sell it again at such price as he thought fit.111. Where the accused removed jute kept in a pond of the complainant for wetting and requested the complainant to take it away as the accused bona fide claimed the ownership of the pond, it was held that no wrongful loss was caused to the complainant.112.\nThe words \"gaining wrongfully,\" or \"losing wrongfully\" would cover cases of wrongful detention of property in the one case and wrongfully being kept out of property in the\n\n\n\n\n\n108.

      "title": "\"Dishonestly.\".",
      "content": "Whoever does anything with the intention of causing wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person, is said to do that thing \"dishonestly\".\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nFrom this definition it will appear that the term 'dishonestly' is not used in the Code in its popular significance. Unless there is wrongful gain to one person, or wrongful loss to another, an act would not be 'dishonest'. Wrongful gain includes wrongful retention and wrongful loss includes being kept out of the property as well as being wrongfully deprived of property.117. An act done with the intention to cause 'wrongful gain' can be said to be dishonest.118. Deceit is not an ingredient of the definition of the word \"dishonestly\". \"Dishonestly\" involves a pecuniary or economic gain or loss.119. Thus, \"dishonestly\" means an intention to cause either wrongful gain or wrongful loss. So where municipal officers demolished and removed an unauthorised structure lawfully by virtue of powers given to them under the Municipal Act, it could not be said that they committed the offence of theft under section 380, IPC, 1860, as their act was not committed dishonestly within the meaning of section 24 read with section 23, IPC, 1860. And since \"dishonesty\" is an essential ingredient of the offence of theft, they could not be charged with that offence.120. A mere erroneous belief and persistence in a wrong or perverse opinion cannot be said to be offence tainted with a dishonest or fraudulent intent.121."

      "content": "A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud 1\nbut not otherwise.\n\n\n\n(xii) Fraudulent cancellation/destruction of valuable security, etc. (section 477)\n(xiii) Fraudulently going through marriage ceremony (section 496).\n\nIt follows therefore, that by merely alleging or showing that a person acted fraudulently, it cannot be assumed that he committed an offence punishable under the Code or any other law, unless that fraudulent act is specified to be an offence under the Code or other law.128.\nThe expression 'defraud' involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person deceived. The injury may even comprise a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. Even in those rare cases where the benefit to the deceiver does not cause corresponding loss to the deceived, the second condition is satisfied.129. The expression \"intent to deceive\" is different from the expression \"intent to defraud\".130. \"Intent to defraud\" is established only when the deception has as its aim some advantage or the likelihood of advantage to the person who causes the deceit or some kind of injury or the possibility of injury to another.131. Thus, where an expert deposing before a court as a defence witness was asked to produce his credentials before the court and it appeared from the documents produced that they were not genuine, it was held that as he acted under the orders of the court and not voluntarily, it could not be said that his intention was to cause any one to act to his disadvantage. In the circumstances, he did not act with \"intent to defraud\". He was, therefore, held liable under sections 193 and 196 but not under sections 465 and 471, IPC, 1860.132."

      "content": "According to the Supreme Court \"the word \"defraud\" includes an element of deceit. Deceit is not an ingredient of the definition of the word \"dishonestly\" while it is an important ingredient of the definition of the word \"fraudulently\". The former involves a pecuniary or economic gain or loss while the latter by construction excludes that element. Further, the juxtaposition of the two expressions \"dishonestly\" and \"fraudulently\" used in the various sections of the Code indicate their close affinity and therefore, the definition of one may give colour to the other. To illustrate, in the definition of \"dishonestly\", wrongful gain or wrongful loss is the necessary ingredient. Both need not exist, one would be enough. So too, if the expression \"fraudulently\" were to be held to involve the element of injury to the person or persons deceived, it would be reasonable to assume that the injury should be something other than pecuniary or economic loss. Though almost always an advantage to one causes loss to another and vice versa, it need not necessarily be so.\"133.\nWhere the accused, after the execution and registration of a document, which was not required by law to be attested, added his name to the document as an attesting witness, it was held that his act was neither fraudulent nor dishonest and the accused was, therefore, not guilty of forgery.134. A person who is not a member of Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribes obtains a false certificate with a view to gain undue advantage to which he or she was not otherwise entitled to would amount to commission of fraud135.

The possession must be conscious and intelligent possession and not merely the physical presence of the accused near the object.141.\nCorporeal property is in a person's possession when he has such power over it that he can exclude others from it, and intends to exercise, if necessary, that power on behalf of himself or of some person for whom he is a trustee.\nA man's goods are in his possession not only while they are in his house or on his premises, but also when they are in a place where he may usually send them (as when horses and cattle feed on common land), or in a place where they may be lawfully deposited by him, e.g., when he buries money or ornaments in his own land, or puts them in any other secret place of deposit.\n1. 'Wife'.—A permanent mistress may be regarded as a 'wife'. When a man furnishes a house for his mistress' occupation, he may reasonably be presumed to be in possession of all articles therein which can reasonably be inferred to belong to him or to be in possession of his mistress on his behalf. But the inference must be inapplicable to articles of which the mistress is in possession illegally or contrary to the provisions of law, especially when the article in question is such that he might well remain in ignorance that it was in his mistress' possession.142.\nUnder this section the possession of the wife or servant must be shown to be on account of the accused otherwise he cannot be held liable for possession by his wife or servant of any incriminatory thing even in his own house. In other words, it must be shown that the accused was in conscious possession of the thing in question through his wife or servant. Moreover, it must also be shown that the possession of the incriminatory thing amounted to an offence under the Indian Penal Code. Thus, possession of illicit liquor or an unlicenced pistol by the wife of the accused in his house would not make him liable for an offence under the Prohibition Act or the Arms Act. The mere fact that the accused was the head of the family would not go to show\n\n\n\n\n\n141. Wahib Basha, AIR 1961 Mad 162 [LNIND 1960 MAD 38] .\n142.

      "content": "A person is said to \"counterfeit\" who causes one thing to resemble another thing, intending by means of that resemblance to practise deception, or knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised.\n144. [Explanation 1.—It is not essential to counterfeiting that the imitation should be exact.\nExplanation 2.—When a person causes one thing to resemble another thing, and the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived thereby, it shall be presumed, until the contrary is proved, that the person so causing the one thing to resemble the other thing intended by means of that resemblance to practise deception or knew it to be likely that deception would thereby be practised.]\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe aforesaid definition states that imitation is not required to be exact. It also says that it is not necessary that counterfeit note should be made with primary intention of its being looked as genuine. It is sufficient if resemblance to genuine currency note is so caused that it is capable to being passed as such.145. In order to apply section 28, what the Court has to see is whether one thing is made to resemble another thing and if that is so and if the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived by it, there will be a presumption of the necessary intention or knowledge to make the thing counterfeit, unless the contrary is proved. The difference between the counterfeit and the original is not therefore, limited to a difference existing only by reason of faulty reproduction.146. The main ingredients of counterfeiting as laid down in section 28, IPC, 1860, are:\n\n(i) causing one thing to resemble another thing,\n(ii) intending by means of such resemblance to practice deception, or\n(iii) knowing it to be likely that deception will thereby be practised.\n\nThere can be counterfeiting even though the imitation is not exact and there are differences in detail between the original and the imitation so long as the resemblance is so close that deception may thereby be practised. And if the resemblance is such that a person might be deceived thereby, it shall be presumed until the contrary is proved that the person causing one thing to resemble another thing was intending by means of that resemblance to practise deception or knew it to be likely that deception would thereby be practised.147.\n\nThe word 'counterfeit' occurs in offences relating to coin provided in Chapter XII and offences relating to property marks and currency notes in Chapter XVIII.\nIf coins are made to resemble genuine coins and the intention of the makers is merely to use them in order to foist a false case upon their enemies, those coins do not come within the definition of counterfeit coins.148. The prosecution must establish that the coins manufactured resemble the original. It must also establish that there is an intention to deceive, or the knowledge that deception would be caused by such resemblance.149."

      "content": "In every part of this Code, except where a contrary intention appears from the context, words which refer to acts 1 done extend also to illegal omissions. 2\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section puts an illegal omission on the same footing as a positive act.\n\n1. 'Acts'.—An 'act' generally means something voluntarily done by a person. 'Act' is a determination of the will, producing an effect in the sensible world. This word includes writing and speaking, or, in short, any external manifestation. In the Code it is not confined to its ordinary meaning of positive conduct of doing something, but includes also illegal omissions.\n2. 'Omissions'.—Liability for an omission requires a legal duty to act; a moral duty to act is not sufficient. A duty arises from the former when an offence is defined in terms of omission. This is the situation where the legislature has made it an offence. A legal duty to act may also be created by a provision of either criminal or civil separate from the offence charged. Since there is no moral difference between (i) a positive act and\n(ii) an omission when a duty is established, it is to be borne in mind that cases of omissions, the liability should be exceptional and needs to be adequately justified in each instance. Secondly, when it is imposed this should be done by clear statutory language. Verbs primarily denoting (and forbidding) active conduct should not be construed to include omissions except when the statute contains a genuine implication to this effect.165.\nAn 'act' generally means something voluntarily done by a person, but in IPC, 1860 the term 'act' is not confined to its ordinary meaning of positive conduct of doing something but includes also illegal omission. The effect of sections 32 and 33, IPC, 1860 taken together is that the term 'act' comprises one or more 'acts' or one or more illegal omissions. The Code (IPC, 1860) makes punishable omissions which have caused, which have been intended to cause or which have been known to be likely to cause certain evil effect in the same manner as it punishes acts provided they were illegal and when the law imposes on a person a duty to act, his illegal omission to act renders (him) in liable to punishment.166."

However, section 34 of the IPC, 1860 makes an exception to this principle. It lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of common intention, animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. It deals with the doing of separate acts, similar or adverse by several persons, if all are done in furtherance of common intention. In such situation, each person is liable for the result of that as if he had done that act himself.171. The soul of section 34, IPC, 1860 is the joint liability in doing a criminal act.172."

      "content": "Section 34 IPC, 1860 is part of the original Code of 1860 as drafted by Lord Macaulay. The original section as it stood was \"When a criminal act is done by several persons, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if the act was done by him alone.\" However, on account of certain observations made by Sir Barnes Peacock, CJ, in Queen v Gora Chand Gope,173. it was necessary to bring about a change in the wordings of the section. Accordingly, in the year 1870 an amendment was brought which introduced the following words after \"when a criminal act is done by several persons...\" \"…in furtherance of the common intention...\". After this change, the section has not been changed or amended ever."

      "title": "Object.—",
      "content": "The provision is intended to meet a case in which it may be difficult to distinguish between acts of individual members of a party who act in furtherance of the common intention of all or to prove exactly what part was taken by each of them. The true contents of the section are that if two or more persons intentionally do an act jointly, the position in law is just the same as if each of them has done it individually by himself. As observed in Ashok Kumar v State of Punjab,174. the existence of a common intention amongst the participants in a crime is the essential element for application of this section. It is not necessary that the acts of the several persons charged with commission of an offence jointly must be the same or identically similar. The acts may be different in character, but must have been actuated by one and the same common\n\nintention in order to attract the provision.175. Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,176.\nstated the true purport of section 34 as:\n\nThe words of s.34 are not to be eviscerated by reading them in this exceedingly limited sense. By s.33 a criminal act in s.34 includes a series of acts and, further, 'act' includes omission to act, for example, an omission to interfere in order to prevent a murder being done before one's very eyes. By s.37, when any offence is committed by means of several acts whoever intentionally cooperates in the commission of that offence by doing any one of those acts, either singly or jointly with any other person, commits that offence. Even if the appellant did nothing as he stood outside the door, it is to be remembered that in crimes as in other things 'they also serve who only stand and wait'.177."

    "section34.3": {
      "title": "Principle.—",
      "content": "This section is only a rule of evidence and does not create a substantive offence. Section 34 IPC, 1860 lays down the principle of constructive liability. The essence of section 34 IPC, 1860 is a simultaneous consensus of the minds of the persons participating in criminal action to bring about a particular result. Section 34 IPC, 1860 stipulates that the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention. In fact, the section is intended to cover a case where a number of persons act together and on the facts of the case it is not possible for the prosecution to prove as to which of the persons who acted together actually committed the crime. Little or no distinction exists between a charge for an offence under a particular section and a charge under that section read with section 34.178. Therefore, section 34, IPC, 1860, would apply even if no charge is framed under that section provided of course from the evidence it becomes clear that there was pre-arranged plan to achieve the commonly intended object.179. Thus, where six persons were charged under sections 148, 302/149 and 307/149, IPC, 1860, but two were acquitted, the remaining four accused could be convicted on the charges of murder and attempt to murder with the aid of section 34 of the Penal Code.180. This section really means that if two or more persons intentionally do a thing jointly, it is just the same as if each of them had done it individually.181. If the criminal act was a fresh and independent act springing wholly from the mind of the doer, the others are not liable merely because when it was done they were intending to be partakers with the doer in a different criminal act."

    "section34.4": {
      "title": "Scope, ambit and applicability.—",
      "content": "Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code recognises the principle of vicarious liability in criminal jurisprudence. The said principle enshrined under Section 34 of the Code would be attracted only if one or more than one accused person act conjointly in the commission of offence with others. It is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identified before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked. So long as the evidence brought by the prosecution would disclose that one or more accused persons had acted in concert with other persons not named or identified, the liability under Section 34 of the Code would still be attracted. Once the other accused stands acquitted in absence of said evidence, the vicarious liability under section 34 of the Code would not be attracted so as to hold the accused liable for the offence with the aid of Section 34 of the Code. However, the accused would still be liable for the offence if the injury or injuries leading to offence can be attributed to him.182. A bare reading of this section shows that the section could be dissected as follows:\n\n(a) Criminal act is done by several persons;\n(b) Such act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all; and\n(c) Each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as if it were done by him alone.\n\n(d) But, it is not necessary that all such persons should be named and identified before the liability under Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code can be invoked.183.\nIn other words, these three ingredients would guide the court in determining whether an accused is liable to be convicted with the aid of section 34. While first two are the acts which are attributable and have to be proved as actions of the accused, the third is the consequence. Once the criminal act and common intention are proved, then by fiction of law, criminal liability of having done that act by each person individually would arise. The criminal act, according to section 34 IPC, 1860 must be done by several persons. The emphasis in this part of the section is on the word \"done\".184. The section does not envisage the separate act by all the accused persons for becoming responsible for the ultimate criminal act. If such an interpretation is accepted, the purpose of section 34 shall be rendered infructuous.185. Under section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, a pre- concert in the sense of a distinct previous plan is not necessary to be proved.186. It is a well settled law that mere presence or association with other members is not per se sufficient to hold each of them criminally liable for the offences committed by the other members, unless there is sufficient evidence on record to show that one such member also intends to or knows the likelihood of commission of such an offending act.187."

      "title": "Three leading Cases.—",
      "content": "The case of Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,188. is a locus classicus and has been followed by number of High Courts and the Supreme Court in a large number of cases. In this case, the Judicial Committee dealt with the scope of section 34 dealing with the acts done in furtherance of the common intention, making all equally liable for the results of all the acts of others. It was observed that section 34 when it speaks of a criminal act done by several persons in furtherance of the common intention of all, has regard not to the offence as a whole, but to the criminal act, that is to say, the totality of the series of acts which result in the offence. In the case of a person assaulted by many accused, the criminal act is the offence which finally results, though the achievement of that criminal act may be the result of the action of several persons.\nIn another celebrated case Mehbub Shah v King-Emperor,189. the court held that:\n\nSection 34 lays down a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The section does not say \"the common intentions of all,\" nor does it say \"an intention common to all.\" Under the section, the essence of that liability is to be found in the existence of a common intention animating the accused leading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention. To invoke the aid of s.34 successfully, it must be shown that the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in concert pursuant to the pre- arranged plan.\n\nApproving the judgments of the Privy Council in Barendra Kumar Ghosh (Barendra Kumar Ghosh v King Emperor,190. and Mahbub Shah cases191 a three-Judge Bench of Supreme Court in Pandurang v State of Hyderabad,192. held that to attract the applicability of section 34 of the Code the prosecution is under an obligation to establish that there existed a common intention which requires a pre-arranged plan because before a man can be vicariously convicted for the criminal act of another, the act must have been done in furtherance of the common intention of all. The Court had in mind the ultimate act done in furtherance of the common intention"

    "section34.6": {
      "title": "Common intention and mens rea.—",
      "content": "Under section 34, every individual offender is associated with the criminal act which constitutes the offence both physically as well as mentally i.e. he is a participant not only in what has been described as a common act but also what is termed as the common intention and, therefore, in both these respects his individual role is put into serious jeopardy although this individual role might be a part of a common scheme in which others have also joined him and played a role that is similar or different. But referring to the common intention, it needs to be clarified that the courts must keep in mind the fine distinction between \"common intention\" on the one hand and mens rea as understood in criminal jurisprudence on the other. Common intention is not alike or identical to mens rea. The latter may be coincidental with or collateral to the former but they are distinct and different.193."
    },
    "section34.7": {
      "title": "Participation.—",
      "content": "Participation of several persons in some action with the common intention of committing a crime is an essential ingredient; once such participation is established, section 34 is at once attracted.194. Thus, the dominant feature of section 34 is the element of intention and participation in action. This participation need not in all cases be by physical presence.195. The Supreme Court has held that it is the essence of the section that the person must be physically present at the actual commission of the crime. He need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape, but he must be physically present at the scene of the occurrence and must actually participate in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time crime is actually being committed.196.\n\nThe Supreme Court has emphasised that proof of participation by acceptable evidence may in circumstances be a clue to the common intention and that it would not be fatal to the prosecution case that the culprits had no community of interests.197.\nSometimes, however, absence of actual participation may serve an important purpose as it happened, for example, where in a love triangle the paramour killed the woman's husband and she remained sitting with the dead body inside the house without opening the door. The main accused having been acquitted, the Supreme Court held that the woman alone could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34 particularly in view of the fact that the nature of the injuries (gandasa blows with a heavy hand) made it explicit that they were the handiwork of masculine power and not that of feminine hands.198. It is also necessary to remember that mere presence of the offender at the scene of murder without any participation to facilitate the offence is not enough.199. By merely accompanying the accused one does not become liable for the crime committed by the accused within the meaning of section 34, IPC, 1860.200. The degree of participation is also an important factor.201. The court restated the two ingredients for application of the section which are:\n\n(i) common intention to commit a crime, and\n(ii) participation by all the accused in the act or acts in furtherance of the common intention. These two things establish their joint liability.202.\nWhere one of the accused persons focussed light on the victim with a torch so as to enable others to assault him, otherwise it is a dark night. The court said that his conduct prior and subsequent to the occurrence clearly showed that he shared the common intention so far as the assault on the deceased was concerned. Hence, he was rightly roped in under section 34.203. If participation is proved and common intention is absent, section 34 cannot be invoked.204. The co-accused was standing outside the house, where the incident took place, while the others committed the\n\nmurder. There is no evidence of his having played any part in the crime. He did not even act as a guard; he did not prevent the witness from entering the house. There is no evidence of the formation or sharing of any common intention with the other accused. No weapon was seized from him, nor was any property connected with the crime, confiscated from him. It was therefore, held that, it was not safe to convict the co- accused of the offence of murder with the aid of sub-sections 34 and 120(B).205."

    "section34.8": {
      "title": "Physical Presence not sine qua non.—",
      "content": "Physical presence at the very spot is not always a necessary ingredient to attract the action. The Supreme Court decision in Shreekantiah Ramayya v State of Bombay,206. is the authority for the aforesaid proposition. Vivian Bose, J, speaking for the Bench of three Judges stated thus:\nHe need not be present in the actual room; he can, for instance, stand guard by a gate outside ready to warn his companions about any approach of danger or wait in a car on a nearby road ready to facilitate their escape.\n\nWhat is required is his actual participation in the commission of the offence in some way or other at the time when the crime is actually being committed. The participation need not in all cases be by physical presence. In offence involving physical violence, normally presence at the scene of offence may be necessary, but such is not the case in respect of other offences when the offence consists of diverse acts which may be done at different times and places. The physical presence at the scene of offence of the offender sough to be rendered liable under this section is not one of the conditions of its applicability in every case.207. Even the concept of presence of the co-accused at the scene is not a necessary requirement to attract section 34 of the IPC, 1860, e.g., the co-accused can remain a little away and supply weapons to the participating accused either by throwing or by catapulting them so that the participating accused can inflict injuries on the targeted person. There may be other provisions in the IPC, 1860 like sub- sections 120B or 109 which could be invoked then to catch such non-participating accused. Thus, participation in the crime in furtherance of the common intention is sine qua non for section 34 IPC, 1860. Exhortation to other accused, even guarding the scene etc. would amount to participation. Of course, when the allegation against an accused is that he participated in the crime by oral exhortation or by guarding the scene the court has to evaluate the evidence very carefully for deciding whether that person had really done any such act.208.\nThe absence of any overt act of assault, exhortation or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of common intention.209."
    },
    "section34.9": {
      "title": "In furtherance of common intention.—",
      "content": "The Supreme Court referred to the Oxford English Dictionary where the word \"furtherance\" is defined as an \"action of helping forward.\" Russell, in his book on Criminal Law adopted this definition and said:\nIt indicates some kind of aid or assistance proceeding an effect in future and that any act may be regarded as done in furtherance of the ultimate felony if it is a step intentionally taken for the purpose of effecting the felony.\" The Supreme Court has also construed the word \"furtherance\" as \"advancement or promotion.210.\n\n1. 'Common intention'.—The phrase 'common intention' means a pre-oriented plan and acting in pursuance to the plan. The common intention to give effect to a particular act may even develop at the spur of moment between a number of persons with reference to the facts of a given case.211. In Amrik Singh's case it has further been held that though common intention may develop in course of the fight but there must be clear and unimpeachable evidence to justify that inference.212. Before a Court can convict a person for any offence read with section 34, it should come to a definite conclusion\n\nthat the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence.213. Where the act of murder by the main accused was facilitated by two others by catching hold of the victim but without knowing nor having the intention of causing death, it was held that the only common intention that could be inferred was that of causing grievous hurt.214. Where the accused had inflicted lathi blows causing injuries only on the eyewitness and not on the deceased, he could not be said to have shared the common intention of committing murder of the deceased. He was acquitted for the charge of murder and was convicted under section 325.215.\n\nCommon intention does not mean similar intention of several persons. To constitute common intention it is necessary that the intention of each one of them be known to the rest of them and shared by them.216.\nWhat to speak of similar intention even same intention without sharing each other's intention is not enough for this section.217. In a case like this each will be liable for whatever injury he caused but none could be vicariously convicted for the act of any of the others.218. In fine, if common intention cannot be inferred from the evidence of facts and circumstances of the case, section 34, IPC, 1860, cannot be invoked.219. A party of farmers was cutting their crop. The deceased took away a portion of the harvested crop. That night when he was returning from a barat 16 persons waited for him on the way. They came towards him and the convict who was carrying a knife gave him a stab wound on the neck which proved fatal. The others did not know that he had a knife and all of them being with bare hands, it could not be said that they had the common intention of causing death. They could as well have thought that after surrounding the accused he would be called upon to return or pay for the harvest taken away by him.220.A person gifted his land to one of his grandsons. His other son along with his wife fully armed, the man with a lathi and the woman with a gandasa came to protest. The man lost control and both grandson and his father intervened to save the situation but they received lathi blows and died. The woman struck only her brother-in- law with the gandasa causing a non-fatal injury. Her husband was convicted for murder but her punishment was reduced to causing grievous hurt because it appeared that the whole thing was a spot happening and not a planned affair.221.\n\nWhere the genesis of the verbal wrangle between the neighbours was not known, but it appeared to have arisen suddenly, there being no chance for common intention to be formulated, each attacker was held to be punishable for his individual acts.222.\nWhere common intention was established the mere fact that one of the culprits distanced himself from the scene could not absolve him from liability.223.\nIt is not necessary for bringing a case within the scope of section 34 to find as to who in fact inflicted the fatal blow. A conviction under the section read with the relevant substantive provision can be made when the ingredients required by the section are satisfied and it is not necessary to mention the section number in the judgment.224. Death of two persons was caused by unprovoked firing by appellants who are police officials and grievous gunshot injuries to another person. It was not necessary to assign a specific role to each individual appellant as the firing at the Car was undoubtedly with a clear intent to annihilate those in it and was resorted to in furtherance of common intention of all the appellants. The accused were liable to conviction under section 302/34 IPC, 1860.225. The acts of all the accused need not be the same or identically similar. All that is necessary is that they all must be actuated by the one and the same common intention. The fact that two of them caused injuries at the back of their victim and the injury at the head which proved to be fatal was caused\n\nby the third person, the two co-accused could not claim to be absolved of liability for murder.226.\nIt is not necessary for bringing about the conviction of the co-accused to show that he also committed an overt act for the achievement of their object. The absence of any overt act or possession of weapon cannot be singularly determinative of absence of common intention. If common intention by meeting of minds is established in the facts and circumstances of the case there need not be an overt act or possession of weapon required, to establish common intention.227.\nThe accused caught hold of the victim and exhorted the main accused to strike him. On such exhortation the main accused inflicted a Kirpan wound. The victim died. It was held that the instigation was only to strike. It could not be said that the accused shared the intention of the main accused to kill. The conviction was altered from under sections 202/34 to one under section 324.228. The victim woman was murdered by her father-in-law and brother-in-law. The third person helped them to conceal the dead body to screen them. The conviction of the two accused for murder was upheld but that of the third one only for concealment of evidence under sections 201/34.229."

Common intention is a state of mind. It is not possible to read a person's mind. There can hardly be direct evidence of common intention. The existence or non- existence of a common intention amongst the accused has to be deciphered cumulatively from their conduct and behaviour in the facts and circumstances of each case. Events prior to the occurrence as also after, and during the occurrence, are all relevant to deduce if there existed any common intention. There can be no straight jacket formula.231. The Court has to examine the prosecution evidence in regard to application of section 34 cumulatively and if the ingredients are satisfied, the consequences must follow. It is difficult to state any hard and fast rule which can be applied universally to all cases. It will always depend on the facts and circumstances of the given case whether the person involved in the commission of the crime with a common intention can be held guilty of the main offence committed by them together.232. Courts, in most cases, have to infer the intention from the act(s) or conduct of the accused or other relevant circumstances of the case. However, an inference as to the common intention shall not be readily drawn; the criminal liability can arise only when such inference can be drawn with a certain degree of assurance.233. In most cases it has to be inferred from the act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the case in hand.234. This inference can be gathered by the manner in which the accused arrived on the scene and mounted the attack, the determination and concert with which the beating was given or the injuries caused by one or some of them, the acts done by others to assist those causing the injuries, the concerted conduct subsequent to the commission of the offence, for instance all of them left the scene of the incident together and other acts which all or some may have done as would help in determining the common intention. In other words, the totality of the circumstances must be taken into consideration in arriving at the conclusion whether the accused had a common intention to commit an offence of which they could be convicted.235. Manner of attack shows the common intention of accused.236. The Supreme Court has reiterated:\nWe reiterate that for common intention, there could rarely be direct evidence. The ultimate decision, at any rate would invariably depend upon the inference deducible from the circumstances of each case. It is settled law that the common intention or the intention of the individuals concerned in furtherance of the common intention could be proved either\n\nfrom direct evidence or by inference from the acts or attending circumstances of the case and conduct of the parties.237."

Where the appellants caused injuries not enough to cause the death but the same were caused by another, in the absence of a charge under section 34, they were found to be guilty under section 326 of IPC, 1860.240.\nSections 34, 114 and 149 of the IPC, 1860 provide for criminal liability viewed from different angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men actuated by a common object or a common intention; and as explained by five Judge Constitution Bench of in Willie Slavey v The State of MP,241. the charge is a rolled-up one involving the direct liability and the constructive liability without specifying who are directly liable and who are sought to be made constructively liable.242. But before a court can convict a person under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, it should come to a definite conclusion that the said person had a prior concert with one or more other persons, named or unnamed, for committing the said offence. A few illustrations will bring out the impact of section 34 on different situations.\n\n(1) A, B, C and D are charged under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, for committing the murder of E. The evidence is directed to establish that the said four persons have taken part in the murder.\n(2) A, B, C and D and unnamed others are charged under the said sections. But evidence is adduced to prove that the said persons, along with others, named or unnamed, participated jointly in the commission of that offence.\n(3) A, B, C and D are charged under the said sections. But the evidence is directed to prove that A, B, C and D, along with 3 others, have jointly committed the offence. As regards the third illustration, a Court is certainly entitled to come to the conclusion that one of the named accused is guilty of murder under section 302, read with section 34, of the Indian Penal Code, though the other three named accused are acquitted, if it accepts the evidence that the said accused acted in concert along with persons, named or unnamed, other than those acquitted, in the commission of the offence. In the second illustration the Court can come to the same conclusion and convict one of the named accused if it is satisfied that no prejudice has been caused to the accused by the defect in the charge. But in the first illustration the Court certainly can convict two or more of the named accused if it accepts the evidence that they acted conjointly in committing the offence. But what is the position if the Court acquits 3 of the 4 accused either because it rejects the prosecution evidence or because it gives the benefit of doubt to the said accused? Can it hold, in the absence of a charge as well as evidence, that though the three accused are acquitted, some other unidentified persons acted conjointly along with one of the named persons? If the Court could do so, it would be making out a new case for the prosecution: it would be deciding contrary to the evidence adduced in the case. A Court cannot obviously make out a case for the prosecution which is not disclosed either in the charge or in regard to which there is no basis in the evidence. There must be some foundation in the evidence that persons other than those named have taken part in the commission of the offence and if there\n\nis such a basis the case will be covered by the third illustration.243. Absence of charge under section 34 is not fatal by itself unless prejudice to the accused is shown.244."

      "content": "Though both these sections relate to the doctrine of vicarious liability and sometimes overlap each other there are substantial points of difference between the two. They are as under:—\n\n(i) Section 34 does not by itself create any specific offence, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, does so (see discussion under sub-para \"principle\" ante).\n(ii) Some active participation, especially in a crime involving physical violence is necessary under section 34 but section 149, IPC, 1860, does not require it and the liability arises by reason of mere membership of the unlawful assembly with a common object and there may be no active participation at all in the preparation and commission of the crime.\n(iii) Section 34 speaks of common intention but section 149, IPC, 1860, contemplates common object which is undoubtedly wider in its scope and amplitude than intention. If the offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly is in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object, all other members of the unlawful assembly would be guilty of that offence under section 149, IPC, 1860, although they may not have intended to do it or participated in the actual commission of that offence.246.\n(iv) Section 34 does not fix a minimum number of persons who must share the common intention, whereas section 149, IPC, 1860, requires that there must be at least five persons who must have the same common object (see also discussion under sub-head \"Sections 34 and 149\" under section 149, IPC, 1860, infra).247."

If the act is done in furtherance of their common intention, all of them become equally liable for the act. Similarly, if they are members of an unlawful assembly, an act done by any one in prosecution of the common object or any act which the members knew could happen in such prosecution, every member would be liable for the act. If any one of them happens to be wrongly acquitted and no appeal has been filed against it, it would not ipso facto impede the conviction of others.\n\nLikewise, the conviction of any one or more them does not automatically result in the conviction of others.248."

The sentence for offence under section 397 of the IPC, 1860 cannot be awarded to those of the members of the group of dacoits who did not use any deadly weapon. A plain reading of section 397 of the IPC, 1860 would make it clear that such guilt can be attributed only to that offender who uses any deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt to any person during course of the commission of the robbery. The provision postulates that only the individual act of accused will be relevant to attract section 397 of the IPC, 1860.252. In a sudden quarrel over payment, person sitting inside the car pulled the petrol pump attendant into the car and drove away. The occupants of the car escaped punishment. It was held that the driver alone could not be held guilty of the offence of robbery and abduction with the aid of section 34.253. In a serial highway robbery and murder in which same persons were involved, it was found as a fact that the self-same two persons were seen by a witness together in a different town before the occurrence. One of their victims survived and he also testified that he saw both of them together. Both of them were held to be guilty of successive crimes and convicted for murder with the aid of section 34 without any need of knowing who played what part.254."

The only allegation against the appellant was her exhortation. Enmity between the family of the deceased and that of the accused proved. In such a situation, where the eye witnesses have not narrated any specific role carried by the appellant, rather the specific role of assaulting with the sword has been attributed to the co- accused, it cannot be ruled out that the name of the appellant has been added due to enmity with the main accused.262."

      "title": "Common intention and private defence.—",
      "content": "If two or more persons had common intention to commit murder and they had participated in the acts done by them in furtherance of that common intention, all of them would be guilty of murder. Section 96 IPC, 1860 says that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. Though all the accused would be liable for committing the murder of a person by doing an act or acts in furtherance of the common intention, they would not be liable for the act or acts if they had the right of private defence to voluntarily cause death of that person. Common intention, therefore, has relevance only to the offence and not to the right of private defence. What would be an offence by reason of constructive liability would cease to be one if the act constituting the offence was done in exercise of the right of private defence.\nIf the voluntary causing of death is not permissible under the right of private defence under section 96, then the common intention in regard thereto will lead to the result that the accused persons must be held guilty by reason of constructive liability under the relevant section (in this case section 304 Part I IPC, 1860). If, however, the common intention was only to commit an act which was permissible within the confines of s. 96 read with s. 98, then constructive liability under section 34 cannot be said to have been accrued to the accused. If the right of private defence was exceeded by some persons, the guilt of each of the accused proved to have exceeded the right of private defence would have to be dealt with separately. The instant case came under the former situation, and hence, such persons were guilty under section 304, Part I IPC, 1860. They, therefore, must be held to have had a common object for causing death of P. They were sentenced to undergo ten years' rigorous imprisonment each.264.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n170.

Under this section several persons who actually perform the act must be shown to have the particular intent or knowledge, if the act is criminal only by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention. If several persons, having one and the same criminal intention or knowledge, jointly commit murder or an assault, each is liable for the offence as if he has acted alone; but if several persons join in an act, each having a different intention or knowledge from the others, each is liable according to his own criminal intention or knowledge, and he is not liable further. If an act which is an offence in itself and without reference to any criminal knowledge or intention on the part of the doers is done by several persons, each of such persons is liable for the offence.\nNeither section 34 nor this section provides that those who take part in the act are jointly liable for the same offence. They merely provide that each of the performers shall be liable for the act in the same manner as if the act were done by him alone. In this section also, the responsibility is shared by each offender individually if the act which is criminal only by reason of certain criminal knowledge or intention is done by each person sharing that knowledge or intention.265. A mere look at that section shows that if the act alleged against these accused becomes criminal on account of their sharing common knowledge about the defective running of Plant at Bhopal by the remaining accused who represented them on the spot and who had to carry out their directions from them and who were otherwise required to supervise their activity. Section 35 of the Indian Penal Code could at least prima facie be invoked against accused 2, 3, 4 and 12 to be read with section 304-A Indian Penal Code.266.\n\n265.

B, having ill-will towards Z and intending to kill him, and not having been subject to the provocation, assists A in killing\nZ. Here, though A and B are both engaged in causing Z's death, B is guilty of murder, and A is guilty only of culpable homicide.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nSection 38 provides that the responsibility for the completed criminal act may be of different grades according to the share taken by the different accused in the completion of the criminal act and this section does not mention anything about intention common or otherwise or knowledge.271.\nSections 34–38 lay down principles similar to the English law of 'principals in the first and second degrees.' See Comment on section 107.\nThe basic principle which runs through sections 32 to 38 is that in certain circumstances an entire act is attributed to a person who may have performed only a fractional part of it. This axiom is laid down in section 34 in which emphasis are on the act. Sections 35–38 take up this axiom as the basis of a further rule by which the criminal liability of the doer of a fractional part (who is to be taken as the doer of the entire act) is to be adjudged in different situations of mens rea. Without the axiom itself, however, the other sections would not work, inasmuch as it is the foundation on which they all stand.272.\nThis section provides for different punishments for different offences as an alternative to one punishment for one offence, whether the persons engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act are set in motion by the one intention or by the other.273. The section applies where a criminal act jointly done by several persons and the several persons have different intentions or states of knowledge in doing the joint act.274.

There is no statutory offence that takes place when adults willingly engage in sexual relations outside the marital setting, with the exception of 'adultery' as defined under section 497 IPC, 1860.285. In Joseph Shine v UOI286. a five judge Constitution bench of the Supreme Court struck down section 497 of the Indian Penal Code as manifestly discriminatory and arbitrary. Section 2(n) of Cr PC, 1973 defines offence as any act or omission made punishable by any law for the time being in force and includes any act in respect of which a complaint may be under section 20 of the Cattle Trespass Act 1871 (1 of 1871). Thus, the definition of 'offence' under section 2(n), Cr PC, 1973, is wider enough to enable the police to investigate into offences under other enactments also, apart from those under the IPC, 1860.287. An offence seldom consists of a single act. It is usually composed of several elements and, as a rule; a whole series of acts must be proved before it can be established.288. There is a basic difference between the offences under the Penal Code and acts and omissions which have been made punishable under different Acts and statutes which are in nature of social welfare legislations. For framing charges in respect of those acts and omissions, in many cases, mens rea is not an essential ingredient; the concerned statute imposes a duty on those who are in charge of the management, to follow the statutory provisions and once there is a breach or contravention, such persons become liable to be punished. But for framing a charge for an offence under the Penal Code, the\n\ntraditional rule of existence of mens rea is to be followed.289. In the absence of a definition in a special act, the term 'offence' should be understood in the context of section 40 of the Indian Penal Code as an act that is criminally punishable and section 3(38) of the General Clauses Act as an act made punishable by any law and the essential ingredient is that it should be a criminal act as understood.290. In Naz Foundation v NCT Delhi.291. section 377 of IPC, 1860 in so far it criminalised consensual sexual acts of adults in private, was held violative of Article 21, Article 14 and Article 15 of the Constitution by the Delhi High Court.292. This judgement of the Delhi High Court was later overruled by the Supreme Court on 12 December 2013 in Suresh Kumar Koushal case.293. Finally in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,294. a five-judge bench of the Supreme Court declared section 377 of the Indian Penal Code unconstitutional, insofar as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults of same sex in private. However, other parts of Section 377 relating to sex with minors and bestiality remain in force."

      "title": "Sections 40 and 141 IPC, 1860.—",
      "content": "Section 40 specifically mentions as to how the term 'offence' will have to be construed. In the main clause of the said section it has been clearly set out that the word \"offence\" denotes a thing made punishable by this Code except the chapters and sections mentioned in clauses 2 and 3 of the said section. Therefore, going by the main clause of section 40, the word \"offence\" since denotes the thing made punishable under the Code, 'other offence' mentioned in section 141 'third', can only denote to offences, which are punishable under any of the provisions of the Code. Therefore, by applying the main clause of section 40, it can be straight away held that all offences referred to in any of the provisions of the Code for which the punishment is provided for would automatically fall within the expression \"other offence\", which has been used in section\n141 'third'. Therefore, a conspectus reading of section 40 makes the position abundantly clear that for all offences punishable under the Indian Penal Code, the main clause of section 40 would straight away apply in which event the expression \"other offence\" used in section 141 'third', will have to be construed as any offence for which punishment is prescribed under the Code. To put it differently, whosoever is proceeded against for any offence punishable under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, section 40 sub-clause 1 would straight away apply for the purpose of construing what the offence is and when it comes to the question of offence under any other special or local law, the aid of sub-clause 2 and 3 will have to be applied for the purpose of construing the offence for which the accused is proceeded against. Therefore, having regard to sub-clause 1 of section 40 of the Code read along with section 141 'third', the argument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants will have to be rejected. Only such a construction would be in tune with the purport and intent of the law makers while defining an unlawful assembly for commission of an offence with a common object, as specified under section 141 of the Code.302.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n279.

It will include any tortious act.\n\nA Magistrate imposed a fine in addition to a sentence of imprisonment on a conviction for the offence of causing death by a rash and negligent act and gave compensation to the widow of the deceased out of the fine imposed. It was held that compensation could not be given to her for she did not suffer any injury as here defined.315. It may, however, be argued that nothing could be more harmful to the mind of a woman than the death of her husband, and the section speaks of harm to the mind as 'injury'. The former Chief Court of the Punjab held that loss of her husband's support affected a widow prejudicially in a legal right, and was therefore, an injury as defined in the Penal Code.316. The context of section 125(1)(c) does not require reference to the definition of 'injury' rendered in section 44 IPC, 1860. The words \"physical or mental abnormality\" will prima facie take in congenital defects while 'injury' leading to inability to maintain itself can have reference, be at any point of time even after the attaining of majority. It may even be possible to take in all cases of physical or mental abnormality which need not necessarily be congenital.317. As defined in section 44 IPC, 1860, \"injury\" denotes any harm whatever illegally caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or property. Now, if a person wants to save himself from injury, such as conviction in a criminal case, it does not mean that he caused injury to another.318. Harm caused to a reputation has been held to constitute an injury, within the purview of section 44.319.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n314. Svami Nayudu v Subramania Mudali, (1864) 2 MHC 158 .\n315.

Therefore, when a punishment for murder is awarded under section 302 of the IPC, 1860, it might be imprisonment for life, where life denotes the life of the convict or death. The term of sentence spanning the life of the convict, can be curtailed by the appropriate Government for good and valid reasons in exercise of its powers under section 432 of the Cr PC, 1973.320. Life imprisonment cannot be equivalent to imprisonment for 14 years or 20 years or even 30 years, rather it always means the whole natural life.321. The expression 'imprisonment for life' must be read in the context of section 45, IPC, 1860.322. The Court may feel that the punishment more just and proper, in the facts of the case, would be imprisonment for life with life given its normal meaning and as defined in section 45 of the Indian Penal Code.323."

      "content": "Nothing is said to be done or believed in \"good faith\" which is done or believed without due care and attention.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe expression \"good faith\" in criminal jurisprudence has a definite connotation. Its import is totally different from saying that the person concerned has honestly believed the truth of what is said. See the language of the law in this regard. It starts in the negative tone excluding all except what is allowed to be within its amplitude. Insistence sought to be achieved through the commencing words of the definition \"nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith\" is that the solitary item included within the purview of the expression \"good faith\" is what is done with \"due care and attention\". Due care denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. In Black's Law Dictionary, \"reasonable care\" is explained as \"such a degree of care, precaution, or diligence as may fairly and properly be expected or required, having regard to the nature of the action, or of the subject matter and the circumstances surrounding the transaction. It is such care as an ordinary prudent person would exercise under the conditions existing at the time he is called upon to act\".331. The element of honesty which is introduced by the definition prescribed by the General Clauses Act is not introduced by the definition of the Penal Code; and we are governed by the definition prescribed by section 52 of that Code.332. Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law, or who by reason of mistake of fact and not by reason of mistake of law, in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.333.\n\nSome parents made poisonous propaganda against an educational institution. The court said that this could not have been done by them in good faith. Hence, the exception to section 499 was not attracted. The complaint of defamation against them could not be quashed.334."

      "title": "Burden of proof.—",
      "content": "The burden is on the accused to prove this fact. Whether a person took due care and attention before he made the imputation is a matter most often within the personal knowledge of that person himself. The accused must prove that he made due enquiries before he published the imputation. It is not enough to say that he made a formal enquiry in a slipshod manner. The words 'due care and attention' imply that the accused must have made the enquiry in a reasonable manner with all circumspection. It is true that the accused is not bound to prove that the enquiry made by him was fool-proof or without the possibility of any error or chance of mistake. However, the accused must show that he got the information from proper source and he had reasonable grounds to\n\nbelieve the truth of the statement he made. The accused must prove by preponderance of probability that there was good faith on his part. The accused also should show that there was no malice on his part, that is to say, that there was no ill-will or spite towards the person against whom he made the imputation. What must ultimately be decided is the honesty of the accused in publishing the words complained of. So also the accused are not entitled to exception 9 of section 499, IPC, 1860 merely on the reason that the publications were not made in good faith.335.\nGood faith is a question of fact to be considered and decided on the facts of each case. Section 52 of the Penal Code emphasizes due care and attention in relation to the good faith. In the General Clauses Act emphasis is laid on honesty.336. The meaning of the expression \"good faith\" is what is done with \"due care and attention\". Due care denotes the degree of reasonableness in the care sought to be exercised. So, before a person proposes to make an imputation, he must first make an enquiry into the factum of the imputation which he proposes to make. It is not enough that he does just a make believe show for an enquiry. The enquiry expected of him is of such a depth as a reasonable and prudent man would make with the genuine intention in knowing the real truth of the imputation. If he does not do so he cannot claim that what he did was bona fide i.e. done in good faith. Thus, a contemner, if he is to establish \"good faith\" has to say that he conducted a reasonable and proper enquiry before making an imputation.337. The question of good faith must be considered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under which he acted. 'Good faith' requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention.338.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n331.

[***]\n\nFourthly.—Imprisonment, which is of two descriptions, namely:—\n\n(1) Rigorous, that is, with hard labour;\n\n(2) Simple;\n\nFifthly.—Forfeiture of property; Sixthly.—Fine.\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe object of punishment in the scheme of modern social defence is correction of the wrongdoer and not wrecking gratuitous punitive vengeance on the criminal. Some attempts have been made to modernise our penal system through piecemeal legislation at best for the first offenders, the children and the juvenile delinquents example the Probation of Offenders Act 1958, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015 etc. In the Indian Penal Code, there is no scope for individualising the punishment; rather these five forms of punishment have to be doled out to the offenders irrespective of their psycho-social problems and needs of individual offenders. Commenting on this unhappy aspect of our penal system Krishna iyer, J, observed in Shivaji's case'.3.\nTwo men in their twenties thus stand convicted of murder and have to suffer imprisonment for life because the punitive strategy of our Penal Code does not sufficiently reflect the modern trends in correctional treatment and personalised sentencing. When accused persons are of tender age then even in a murder case it is not desirable to send them beyond the high prison walls and forget all about their correction and eventual reformation.\n\nIn Inder Singh's case4. the Supreme Court issued directions to the State Government to see that the young accused of the case are not given any degrading work and they are given the benefit of liberal parole every year if their behaviour shows responsibility and trustworthiness. Moreover, the Sessions Judge was directed to make jail visits to ensure compliance with these directions."

      "content": "One of the prime objectives of criminal law is imposition of appropriate, adequate, just and proportionate sentence commensurate with the nature and gravity of crime and\n\nthe manner in which the crime is done.5. Undue sympathy by means of imposing inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system and undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law.6. The object should be to protect the society and to deter the criminal in achieving the avowed object to law by imposing appropriate sentence. It is expected that the Courts would operate the sentencing system so as to impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of the society and the sentencing process has to be stern where it should be.7. The main purpose of the sentence broadly stated is that the accused must realise that he has committed an act which is not only harmful to the society of which he forms an integral part but is also harmful to his own future, both as an individual and as a member of the society. Punishment is designed to protect society by deterring potential offenders as also by preventing the guilty party from repeating the offence; it is also designed to reform the offender and re-claim him as a law-abiding citizen for the good of the society as a whole. Reformatory, deterrent and punitive aspects of punishment thus play their due part in judicial thinking while determining this question. In modern civilized societies, however, reformatory aspect is being given somewhat greater importance. Too lenient as well as too harsh sentences both lose their efficaciousness. One does not deter and the other may frustrate thereby making the offender a hardened criminal.8."

      "title": "Different Approaches.—",
      "content": "Punishment in criminal cases is both punitive and reformative. The purpose is that the person found guilty of committing the offence is made to realise his fault and is deterred from repeating such acts in future. On the commission of crime, three types of reactions may generate; the traditional reaction of universal nature which is termed as punitive approach. It regards the criminal as a notoriously dangerous person who must be inflicted severe punishment to protect the society from his criminal assaults. The other approach is the therapeutic approach. It regards the criminal as a sick person requiring treatment, while the third is the preventive approach, which seeks to eliminate those conditions from the society, which were responsible for crime causation. Under the punitive approach, the rationalisation of punishment is based on retributive and utilitarian theories. Deterrent theory, which is also part of the punitive approach, proceeds on the basis that the punishment should act as a deterrent not only to the offender, but also to others in the community. The therapeutic approach aims at curing the criminal tendencies, which were the product of a diseased psychology. Therapeutic approach has since been treated as an effective method of punishment, which not only satisfies the requirements of law that a criminal should be punished and the punishment prescribed must be meted out to him, but also reforms the criminal through various processes, the most fundamental of which is that in spite of having committed a crime, may be a heinous crime, he should be treated as a human being entitled to all the basic human rights, human dignity and human sympathy. It was under this theory that this Court in a stream of decisions, projected the need for prison reforms, the need to acknowledge the vital fact that the prisoner, after being lodged in jail, does not lose his fundamental rights or basic human rights and that he must be treated with compassion and sympathy.9. Imposing a hard punishment on the accused serves a limited purpose, but at the same time, it is to be kept in mind that relevance of deterrent punishment in matters of serious crimes affecting society should not be undermined. Within the parameters of the law an attempt has to be made to afford an opportunity to the individual to reform himself and lead life of a normal, useful member of society and make his contribution in that regard.10. In Dhannajoy Chatterjee v State of WB,11. the Supreme Court has observed that shockingly large number of criminals go unpunished, thereby increasingly encouraging the criminals and ultimately making justice suffer by weakening the system's credibility. Realising that it is not the brutality of punishment but its surety that serves as a greater deterrent, our Supreme Court held\n\nthat a barbaric crime does not have to be visited with a barbaric penalty such as public hanging which will be clearly violative of Article 21 of the Constitution.12. With regards the question of punishment, it should be noted that punishment in one matter cannot be the guiding factor for punishment in another. Punishment has a co-relation with facts and in each case where punishment is imposed, the same must be the resultant effect of the acts complained of. More serious the violation, more severe is the punishment and that has been the accepted norm, in matters though, however, within the prescribed limits.13."

    "section53.3": {
      "title": "Reformation Theory.—",
      "content": "The reformative aspect is meant to enable the person concerned to relent and repent for his action and make himself acceptable to the society as a useful social being.14. Theory of reformation through punishment is grounded on the sublime philosophy that every man is born good but circumstances transform him into a criminal. The aphorism that \"if every saint has a past every sinner has a future\" is a tested philosophy concerning human life. VR Krishna Iyer, J, has taken pains to ornately fresco the reformative profile of the principles of sentencing in Mohammad Giasuddin v State of AP.15. Reformation should hence be the dominant objective of a punishment and during incarceration, every effort should be made to recreate the good man out of convicted prisoner. An assurance to him that his hard labour would eventually snowball into a handsome saving for his own rehabilitation would help him to get stripped of the moroseness and desperation in his mind while toiling with the rigours of hard labour during the period of his jail life. Thus, reformation and rehabilitation of a prisoner are of great public policy. Hence, they serve a public purpose.16. Punishment is also to reform such wrongdoers not to commit such offence in future.17."
    },
    "section53.4": {
      "title": "Deterrence.—",
      "content": "Deterrence is one of the vital considerations of punishment. Law demands that the offender should be adequately punished for the crime, so that it can deter the offender and other persons from committing similar offences. Nature and circumstances of the offence; the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offence; to afford adequate deterrence to the conduct and to protect the public from such crimes are certain factors to be considered while imposing the sentence.18. Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time or personal inconveniences in respect of such offences will be result-wise counterproductive in the long run and against societal interest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by string of deterrence built in the sentencing system.19. For instance, a murder committed due to deep-seated mutual and personal rivalry may not call for penalty of death. However, an organised crime or mass murders of innocent people would call for imposition of death sentence as deterrence.20. Protection of society and deterring the criminal is the avowed object of law and is required to be achieved by imposing an appropriate sentence. The sentencing Courts are expected to consider all relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by the society in cases of heinous crimes like rape on innocent helpless girls of tender years, as in this case, and respond by imposition of proper sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reflection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the Court. To show mercy in the case of such a heinous crime would be a travesty of justice.21. To give a lesser punishment to the appellants would be to render the justice system of this country suspect. The common man will lose\n\nfaith in the Courts. In such cases, he understands and appreciates the language of deterrence more than the reformative jargon.22. Punishment to an accused in criminal jurisprudence is not merely to punish the wrongdoer but also to strike warning to those who are in the same sphere of crime or to those intending to join in such crime.23."
    },
    "section53.5": {
      "title": "Principles of sentencing.—",
      "content": "Sentencing is an important task in the matters of crime. There is no straitjacket formula for sentencing an accused on proof of crime. In practice, there is much variance in the matter of sentencing. In many countries, there are laws prescribing sentencing guidelines, but there is no statutory sentencing policy in India.24. The Indian Penal Code provides discretion to Indian Judges while awarding the sentence.25. Courts have wide discretion in awarding sentence within the statutory limits.26. The Courts have evolved certain principles: twin objective of the sentencing policy is deterrence and correction.27. There are many philosophies behind sentencing justifying penal consequences. The philosophical/jurisprudential justification can be retribution, incapacitation, specific deterrence, general deterrence, rehabilitation, or restoration. Anyone or a combination thereof can be the goal of sentencing. However, when it comes to sentencing a person for committing a heinous crime, the deterrence theory as a rationale for punishing the offender becomes more relevant. In such cases, the role of mercy, forgiveness and compassion becomes secondary and while determining the quantum of sentence, discretion lies with the Court. While exercising such a discretion, the Court has to govern itself by reason and fair play, and discretion is not to be exercised according to whim and caprice. It is the duty of the Court to impose adequate sentence, for one of the purposes of imposition of requisite sentence is protection of the society and a legitimate response to the collective conscience. While considering as to what would be the appropriate quantum of imprisonment, the Court is empowered to take into consideration mitigating circumstances, as well as aggravating circumstances.28. What sentence would meet the ends of justice depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and the Court must keep in mind the gravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the offence and all other attendant circumstances.29. The criminal law adheres in general to the principle of proportionality in prescribing liability according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct. It ordinarily allows some significant discretion to the Judge in arriving at a sentence in each case, presumably to permit sentences that reflect more subtle considerations of culpability that are raised by the special facts of each case. Judges in essence affirm that punishment ought always to fit the crime; yet in practice, sentences are determined largely by other considerations. Sometimes it is the correctional needs of the perpetrator that are offered to justify a sentence, sometimes the desirability of keeping him out of circulation, and sometimes even the tragic results of his crime. Inevitably, these considerations cause a departure from just desert as the basis of punishment and create cases of apparent injustice that are serious and widespread.30. Proportion between crime and punishment is a goal respected in principle, and in spite of errant notions, it remains a strong influence in the determination of sentences. The practice of punishing all serious crimes with equal severity is now unknown in civilized societies, but such a radical departure from the principle of proportionality has disappeared from the law only in recent times. Even now for a single grave infraction, drastic sentences are imposed. Anything less than a penalty of greatest severity for any serious crime is thought then to be a measure of toleration that is unwarranted and unwise. But in fact, quite apart from those considerations that make punishment unjustifiable when it is out of proportion to the crime, uniformly disproportionate punishment has some very undesirable practical consequences.31. The principle of proportionality in sentencing a crime doer is well entrenched in criminal jurisprudence.\n\nAs a matter of law, proportion between crime and punishment bears most relevant influence in determination of sentencing the crime doer. The Court has to take into consideration all aspects including social interest and consciousness of the society for award of appropriate sentence.32. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats. Imposition of sentence without considering its effect on the social order in many cases may be in reality a futile exercise. The social impact of the crime e.g. where it relates to offences against women, dacoity, kidnapping, misappropriation of public money, treason and other offences involving moral turpitude or moral delinquency which have great impact on social order and public interest, cannot be lost sight of and per se require exemplary treatment. Any liberal attitude by imposing meagre sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time in respect of such offences will be result wise counterproductive in the long run and against societal interest which needs to be cared for and strengthened by a string of deterrence inbuilt in the sentencing system.33. Undue sympathy to impose inadequate sentence would do more harm to the justice system to undermine the public confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under such serious threats. It is, therefore, the duty of every Court to award proper sentence keeping in mind the nature of the offence and the manner in which it was executed or committed etc. Thus, it is evident that Criminal Law requires strict adherence to the rule of proportionality in providing punishment according to the culpability of each kind of criminal conduct keeping in mind the effect of not awarding just punishment on the society.34. An undeserved indulgence or liberal attitude in not awarding adequate sentence in such cases would amount to allowing or even to encouraging 'potential criminals'. The society can no longer endure under such serious threats. Courts must hear the loud cry for justice by society in cases of heinous crime of rape and impose adequate sentence. Public abhorrence of the crime needs reflection through imposition of appropriate sentence by the Court.35."

Since in many offences, only the maximum punishment is prescribed and for some offences the minimum punishment is prescribed, each Judge exercises his discretion accordingly.39. In case where for an offence, maximum imprisonment is prescribed and there is no provision for minimum imprisonment, the Court can exercise wide discretion imposing any imprisonment which may be from one day (or even till the rising of the court) to ten years/life.40. However, the Courts will have to take into account certain principles while exercising their discretion in sentencing, such as proportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is necessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the commensurate punishment for the offender.41. Though punishment is the discretion of the Court, yet it must be exercised judicially and where circumstances call for a deterrent punishment, it ought to be awarded in an appropriate case.42. Thus where the accused, a young man of 22 committed multiple murders for sheer gain in a most cruel, callous and fiendish fashion, there was no way to show him any mercy as it was rarest of the rare cases where a sentence of death was fully justified.43. In exercising this discretion, the Court must consider the gravity of the offence, the mitigating or the extenuating circumstances of the case which may justify the award of the lesser or maximum sentence.44. Where the accused was a youth of 19, the Supreme Court while upholding conviction under section 304-Part I, Indian Penal Code, 1860, (IPC, 1860) reduced his sentence to the period already undergone which was 18 and a half months in the instant case. The accused, a Government servant, who will lose pensionary benefits due to conviction, deserves to be treated leniently.\n\nThe Supreme Court has laid down that in cases of death in custody on account of third degree methods, deterrent punishment should be awarded.45. Where certain police officials, who took a man illegally in their custody and gave him beating due to which he\n\ndied, were convicted under section 342, it was held that the facts that one of the accused was recipient of a medal from the President for saving a life, was awarded Rs. 5,000 by the State Government also and was suffering from T.B. and the other accused had acted on the direction of his superior, were not mitigating circumstances and the accused were liable to be punished with the maximum sentence.46.\nWhere due to dire poverty the accused killed his ailing wife, as he could not provide money for her operation and thereafter killed his two children, as they would be neglected after their mother's death, it was held the accused deserved to be awarded life imprisonment and not capital punishment.47. Where the murder in question showed signs of ruthless, unrelenting and determined vindictiveness and though the accused was 55 at the time of occurrence and 70 at the time of this appeal, the Supreme Court did not think it necessary to modify his sentence of life imprisonment.48. Similarly, where murders were committed for gain, the Supreme Court refused to interfere with death sentence only because the condemned prisoners were very young and their wives and children and aged parents were dependent on them. Such considerations, the Court said, are present in most cases.49. Where, for the offence of dacoity under section 395, the trial Court awarded three years' R.I., the High Court acquitted the offenders, but the Supreme Court restored the conviction after a long gap during which they got married and had resumed normal life, the period already undergone was considered to be sufficient, but a fine of Rs. 3,000 was imposed on each of them.50.\nWhere a conviction under section 16I, IPC, 1860 read with section 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 was confirmed, the Gujarat High Court modified the sentence of R.I. for one year and ordered that the appellant shall undergo sentence of\nR.I. for six months only. This was done in view of his age of 60 years and a number of illnesses he was suffering from.51. The accused had been out of job for nearly 16 years and had undergone the trial for a number of years. He was 65 years old but had received no pension and had a large family to maintain. Hence, the Supreme Court while confirming the conviction, reduced the sentence of one year R.I. each under section 161 and the Prevention of Corruption Act to 15 days R.I. on each count. The sentence of fine was however confirmed.52. Where the accused had accepted a very small amount of Rs. 30 as bribe about 16 years back and underwent the agony of trial for a long time and had to support his family, he had been in jail for some time during trial, considering these facts his sentence of imprisonment was reduced from three months R.I. to the period already undergone.53.\n\nImposition of proper and appropriate sentence is bounded obligation and duty of the Court. The endeavour of the Court must be to ensure that the accused received appropriate sentence. The sentence must be accorded to the gravity of the offence.54."

      "title": "Minimum Sentence.—",
      "content": "In order to exercise the discretion of reducing the sentence the statutory requirement is that the Court has to record \"adequate and special reasons\" in the judgment and not fanciful reasons, which would permit the Court to impose a sentence less than the prescribed minimum. The reason has not only to be adequate but also special. What is adequate and special would depend upon several factors and no straitjacket formula can be indicated.55. Mere absence of provisions for minimum sentence is no reason or justification to treat the offence under the Act (NDPS) as any less serious.56.\n\nFor the offence of murder, minimum sentence is 'life imprisonment'. Thus, the High Court cannot modify the sentence of life imprisonment awarded by the Trial Court to the one already undergone.57.\n\nTo the five kinds of punishments in the section, two more were added by subsequent enactments, viz., whipping (now abolished) and detention in reformatories.\n1. Death.—Death punishment is awarded for murder in rarest of the rare cases.58. It may be awarded as punishment for the following offences:—\n(1) Waging war against the Government of India (section 121).\n\n(2) Abetting mutiny actually committed (section 132).\n\n(3) Giving or fabricating false evidence upon which an innocent person suffers death (section 194).\n(4) Threatening or inducing any person to give false evidence- if innocent person is convicted and sentenced in consequence of such false evidence, with death (195A-Part II)\n(5) Murder (section 302).\n\n(6) Abetment of suicide of a minor, or an insane or an intoxicated person (section 305).\n\n(7) Attempt to murder by life convicts (section 307-PartII)\n\n(8) Kidnapping for ransom, etc. (section 364A)\n\n(9) Causing death or resulting in persistent vegetative state of rape victim (section 376A)\n(10) Repeat offenders of offences punishable under section 376 or section 376A or section 376D (section 376E)\n(11) Dacoity accompanied with murder (section 396).\n\n(12) Attempt to murder by a person under sentence of imprisonment for life, if hurt is caused (section 307). [For the detailed discussion on Death Penalty See Comments under section 302 IPC].\nIn addition to this, Death penalty can be imposed by virtue of section 34, 149,109 and 120B of IPC.\n2. Imprisonment for life is now substituted for transportation. \"Imprisonment for life\" in the Code means \"rigorous imprisonment for life\" and not \"simple imprisonment for life\".59.\n3. Imprisonment.—Imprisonment is of two kinds: (a) rigorous and (b) simple. In the case of rigorous imprisonment, the offender is put to hard labour such as grinding corn, digging earth, drawing water, cutting firewood, bowing wool, etc. In the case of simple imprisonment, the offender is confined to jail and is not put to any kind of work. Imposition of hard labour on prisoners undergoing rigorous imprisonment has been held to be legal.60.\nThe minimum term of imprisonment, however, is fixed in the following two cases: (1) If, at the time of committing robbery or dacoity, the offender uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, he is punished with imprisonment of not less than seven years (section 397).\n(2) If, at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, he is punished with imprisonment of not less than seven years (section 398).\n\nThe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 2013 [Act No. 13 of 2013 w.e.f 2 April 2013] provides minimum punishment for the following offences:\n\n(1) Public servant disobeying direction under law- Imprisonment for a term, which shall not be less than six months. (section 166A)\n(2) Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc.- Imprisonment for not less than ten years. (section 326A)\n(3) Outraging the modesty of a woman- Imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than one year (section 354)\n(4) Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe- Imprisonment of not less than three years. (section 354B)\n(5) Voyeurism- Imprisonment of not less than one year. (section 354C)\n(6) Trafficking of person- Seven years [section 370(2)], ten years [sections 370(3), (4)], 14 years [section 370(5)],\n(7) Exploitation of a trafficked child- Imprisonment of not less than five years but which may extend to seven years and with fine. (section 370A)\n(8) Rape- Seven years [section 376(1)], ten years [section 376(2)].\n(9) Causing death or resulting in persistent vegetative state of victim- Imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 20 years (section 376A)\n(10) Sexual intercourse by husband upon his wife during separation- Imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than two years (section 376B)\n(11) Sexual intercourse by a person in authority- Imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than five years. (section 376C)\n(12) Gang rape- Imprisonment for a term, which shall not be less than 20 years. (section 376D).\nThe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 has further amended the Indian Penal Code 1860. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 has increased the minimum sentence in section 376(1) from seven years to ten years. The 2018 Amendment Act has inserted sections 376AB, 376DA and 376DB which provide for enhanced punishment in certain aggravated forms of rape. Refer Chapter XVI infra.\nAn offender is punished with rigorous imprisonment without the alternative of simple imprisonment, in the cases of—\n(1) Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of an offence, which is capital by this Code (section 194).\n(2) Rape (sections 376, 376A, 376AB, 376C, 376D, 376DA, 376DB and 376E)\n\n(3) House-trespass in order to the commission of an offence punishable with death (section 449).\nThe following offences are punishable with simple imprisonment only:—\n\n(1) Public servant unlawfully engaging in trade; or unlawfully buying or bidding for property (sections 168, 169).\n(2) A person absconding to avoid service of summons or other proceedings from a public servant or preventing service of summons or other proceedings, or preventing\n\npublication thereof; or not attending in obedience to an order from a public servant (sections 172, 173, 174).\n(3) Intentional omission to produce a document to a public servant by a person legally bound to produce such document; or intentional omission to give notice or information to a public servant by a person legally bound to give; or intentional omission to assist a public servant when bound by law to give assistance (sections 175, 176, 187).\n(4) Refusing oath when duly required to take oath by a public servant; or refusing to answer a public servant authorised to question or refusing to sign any statement made by a person himself before a public servant (sections 178, 179, 180).\n(5) Disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant if such disobedience causes obstruction, annoyance, or injury (section 188).\n(6) Escape from confinement negligently suffered by a public servant; or negligent omission to apprehend, or negligent sufferance of escape, on the part of a public servant in cases not otherwise provided for (sections 223, 225-A).\n(7) Intentional insult or interruption to a public servant sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding (section 228).\n(8) Continuance of nuisance after injunction to discontinue (section 291).\n\n(9) Wrongful restraint (section 341).\n\n(10) Defamation: printing or selling defamatory matter known to be so (sections 500, 501, 502).\n(11) Uttering any word, or making any sound or gesture, with an intention to insult the modesty of a woman (section 509).\n(12) Misconduct in a public place by a drunken person (section 510).61."

In sections 370, 376(A), 376(D), 376(E) it is also specifically mentioned that 'Life' shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2018 has increased the minimum sentence in section 376(1) from seven years to ten years as well as inserted sections 376AB, 376DA and 376DB which provide for enhanced punishment in certain aggravated forms of rape. Refer Chapter XVI infra.\nSpending 13 and half years in jail does not mean that the petitioner has undergone a sentence for life.63.\n4. Forfeiture.—The punishment of absolute forfeiture of all property of the offender is now abolished. Sections 61 and 62 of the IPC, 1860 dealing with such forfeiture are repealed by Act XVI of 1921.\nThere are, however, three offences in which the offender is liable to forfeiture of specific property. They are sections 126, 127 and 169 of the Code.64.\n\n5. Fine.—Fine is the only punishment in the following cases:—\n\n(1) A person in charge of a merchant vessel, negligently allowing a deserter from the Army or Navy or Air Force to obtain concealment in such vessel, is liable to a fine not exceeding Rs. 500 (section 137).\n(2) The owner or occupier of land on which a riot is committed or an unlawful assembly is held, and any person having or claiming any interest in such land, and not using all lawful means to prevent such riot or unlawful assembly, is punishable with a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000 (section 154).\n(3) The person for whose benefit a riot has been committed not having duly endeavoured to prevent it (section 155).\n(4) The agent or manager of such person under like circumstances (section 156).\n\n(5) False statements in connection with an election (section 171-G).\n\n(6) Illegal payments in connection with an election (section 171-H).\n\n(7) Failure to keep election accounts (section 171-I).\n\n(8) Voluntarily vitiating the atmosphere so as to render it noxious to the public health, is punishable with a fine up to Rs. 500 (section 278).\n(9) Obstructing a public way or line of navigation, is punishable with a fine not exceeding Rs. 200 (section 283).\n(10) Committing of a public nuisance not otherwise punishable is punishable with a fine not exceeding Rs. 200 (section 290).\n(11) Publication of a proposal regarding a lottery, is punishable with a fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000 (section 294-A).\nWhere the accused partners of a firm were acquitted on a charge under section 420 of making substantial gains for themselves and an appeal against their acquittal was decided against them 15 years after the acquittal, fine and not imprisonment was considered proper punishment.65. Where the murder accused remained in prison for sometime and was on bail for 13 years, he was not committed to prison; a fine of Rs. 50,000 in addition to the imprisonment already undergone was imposed, he being a young man.66. Where the accused along with others convicted under section 323 for six months' imprisonment had already undergone an imprisonment of one year and, looking at his good conduct inside jail and lest he should lose his service, he was given the benefit of section 3 of the Probation of Offenders Act 1958 so to assure that his conviction should not affect his service.67."

      "content": "Section 53 of the IPC, 1860 defines five kinds of punishment which includes punishment for life and two other kinds of imprisonment, i.e., rigorous and simple imprisonment. Rigorous imprisonment is one which is required by law to be completed with hard labour. There are principally two categories of prisoners: (1) under trial prisoners and (2) convicted prisoners (Besides them there are those detained as preventive measure, and those undergoing detention for default of payment of fine). A person sentenced to simple imprisonment cannot be required to work unless he volunteers himself to do the work. However, the Jail officer who requires a prisoner\n\nsentenced to rigorous imprisonment to do hard labour would be doing so as enjoined by law and mandated by the Court.68. Thus, while a person sentenced to simple imprisonment has the option of choosing to work, a person sentenced to rigorous imprisonment is required by law to undergo hard labour. The under trials are not required to work in Jail.69. Section 60 of the Indian Penal Code confers power on a sentencing Court to direct that \"such imprisonment shall be wholly rigorous or that such imprisonment shall be wholly simple, or that any part of such imprisonment shall be rigorous and the rest simple.\" The sentence of \"imprisonment for life\" tagged along with a number of offences delineated in the IPC, 1860 is interpreted as \"rigorous imprisonment for life\" and not simple imprisonment.70.\n\nSupreme Court Guidelines regarding employment of prisoners and wages.—\n\n(1) It is lawful to employ the prisoners sentenced to rigorous imprisonment to do hard labour whether he consents to do it or not.\n(2) It is open to the jail officials to permit other prisoners also to do any work which they choose to do provided such prisoners make a request for that purpose.\n(3) It is imperative that the prisoner should be paid equitable wages for the work done by them. In order to determine the quantum of equitable wages payable to prisoners the State concerned shall constitute a wage fixation body for making recommendations. We direct each State to do so as early as possible.\n(4) Until the State Government takes any decision on such recommendations every prisoner must be paid wages for the work done by him at such rates or revised rates as the Government concerned fixes in the light of the observations made above. For this purpose we direct all the State Governments to fix the rate of such interim wages within six weeks from today and report to this Court of compliance of this direction.\n(5) We recommend to the State concerned to make law for setting apart a portion of the wages earned by the prisoners to be paid as compensation to deserving victims of the offence the commission of which entailed the sentence of imprisonment to the prisoner, either directly or through a common fund to be created for this purpose or in any other feasible mode.\n[State of Gujarat v Hon'ble High Court of Gujarat.71.]"

A man of profession would thus stand stripped of his right to hold consultations while serving out his sentence. But the Constitution guarantees other freedoms like the right to acquire, hold and dispose of property for the exercise of which incarceration can be no impediment, likewise, even a convict is entitled to the precious right guaranteed by Article 21 of the Constitution that he shall not be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.72."

On the other hand, one needs to bear in mind that the consequences of criminal acts catch up with the accused particularly when the crimes are against the society the ethical concept of forgive and forget merely because the incident took place in the distant past will not hold good in a Court of Law.73. Where there was acquittal in the same year in which the crime was committed but the acquittal was reversed after eight years and conviction and jail terms were awarded and appeal against this order was disposed of in the 20th year of the crime, the Supreme Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone and imposed a fine which if not paid, the original sentence was to be restored.74. Where the guilt of the accused under sections 406 and 120-B were established beyond all reasonable doubt, the Supreme Court did not interfere with their conviction. However, in view of the fact that the accused had undergone proceedings for a period of two decades, their sentence was reduced to one already undergone.75. Where the accused was convicted for criminal conspiracy and breach of trust and about 48 years had elapsed since the accused was charged for the offences, keeping in view his advanced age he was sentenced to imprisonment till rising of the Court with a fine of Rs. 5,000.76. Where a man of 20 was convicted under section 324 and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for four months whereas he had already undergone imprisonment of one year and two months, his sentence was reduced to one already undergone.77. Where the accused were convicted under section 326 for causing grievous hurt to the victim, considering the lapse of about six years from the incident, accused not being habitual criminals or previous convicts and there being no misuse of liberty during bail, the sentence was reduced to the period already undergone with a fine of Rs. 5,000 each.78. Where the accused convicted and sentenced under sections 379 and 411, were found to be the sole earning member of their families and they had no past criminal records, the Court directed that one year's rigorous imprisonment instead of two would meet the ends of justice.79. Where the accused seeing his wife in a compromising position with a man assaulted both of them as a result of grave and sudden provocation resulting in the death of both, his conviction under section 304, Part II was upheld but the sentence of five years' R.I. was reduced to one years' R.I. with the recommendation that the State Government might remit such a portion of sentence as it deemed fit and proper.80."

Where the accused, in his late fifties, betraying the confidence of the prosecutrix committed rape on her, it was held that he deserved no sympathy. However, as the accused remained in jail for eight years, the Court took a liberal view and considering his age and helplessness sentenced him to the period for which he had already been in jail.82. Where the victim of rape belonged to a tribal (Bhilla) community and the act of the accused did not cast any serious stigma on the girl and she was married to a different person sometime after the incident by her father, it was held that sentence much below the minimum sentence prescribed could be inflicted on the accused.83. Where the conviction and sentence of the accused\n\nhusband to rigorous imprisonment for six months under section 498-A was substituted with a fine of Rs. 6,000, taking into consideration the age, occupation and family conditions of the husband, it was held that though the appellate Court was justified in substituting the jail sentence, the Court ought not have awarded a modest fine. The fine was raised to Rs. 30,000.84. Where a person was married in childhood and was subjected to a second marriage under the pressure exerted by his parents as well as the woman who became his second wife, it was held that a lesser sentence of six months instead two years' R.I. and a fine of Rs. 2,000 to the accused husband and imprisonment till the rising of the Court and a fine of Rs. 1,500 to the accused parents and the second wife in place of the original sentence of six months' R.I. and a fine of Rs. 1,000 would meet the ends of justice.85."

It is indeed a step forward in our criminal justice system.89. The purpose of imposition of fine and/or grant of compensation to a great extent must be considered having the relevant factors therefore in mind. It may be compensating the person in one way or the other.90.\n\nIn the BMW Case, the Supreme Court directed the accused to pay an amount of Rs. 50 lakh to the Union of India which will be utilized within for providing compensation to the victims of motor accidents, where the vehicles owner, driver etc. could not be traced, like victims of hit and run cases.91. Where a doctor was convicted for an attempt to cause miscarriage and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year and pay a fine of Rs. 5,000, the sentence of imprisonment was found to be excessive and was set aside but the fine was enhanced to Rs. 15,000 out of which, if realised Rs. 10,000 was to be paid to the mother of the deceased for the maintenance of the children of the deceased shown to be living with her.92. The accused, an agriculturist, assaulted his sister's husband with a knife giving a blow in his abdomen resulting in death.

But on special facts of the case an option was given to the accused to pay a fine of Rs. 40,000 in all and in default to undergo R.I. for seven years and, if the fine was paid within 12 weeks, jail sentence was to be reduced to three years' R.I. Out of the fine, if paid, Rs. 10,000 were to be given to the mother of the deceased and Rs. 30,000 utilised for the benefit of the three minor children of the deceased in sum of Rs. 10,000 each.93. Where the accused caused a serious injury in the abdomen of a man and was convicted under section 307 but considering that he had a widowed mother and two children and was willing to compensate the victim substantially, sentence imposed upon him was modified into one of fine in the way of compensation of Rs. One lakh.94. Where in a case under section 304, Part II the accused remained in custody for over a year after conviction by the High Court and also for sometime during investigation, the Apex Court reduced the sentence to the period already undergone but imposed a fine of Rs. 20,000 payable to the widow of the deceased as compensation.95."

The fact that for this reason he became the victim of police cruelty was also considered to be not a mitigating circumstance.99. In a double murder case, the accused was awarded death sentence but the execution was postponed. It was held that pain, agony and horror suffered by the prisoner after he was informed about execution was no ground for substituting death sentence.100. Where the accused constructed a water tank which collapsed due to use of low quality material resulting in the death of several persons and the accused was sentenced to the maximum of two years of R.I. provided under section 304A, it\n\nwas held that the sentence could not be reduced merely because the matter was more than seven years old and that it would also be a grave injustice to the victims of the crime.101.

Voluntary intoxication by itself neither absolves the offender of the consequences of his act nor does it makes him liable for lesser offence.105. The mere fact that the accused inflicted a single injury resulting in death is not sufficient in itself to convert the offence from one under sections 300–304, Part II.106. When the victim has sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the body and the injury is life-threatening imposition of sentence of six days only which was the period already undergone by the accused in confinement is too lenient. However, as the parties have forgotten their differences and are living peacefully since 25 years, the Court taking into consideration the aggravating as well as mitigating factors under the facts of this case, imposed a sentence of six months' R.I. and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.107."

      "content": "Where the accused committed rape on a woman and killed her and it was found that he had behaved like an animal, it was held that it was not a fit case for showing leniency.108. Where in a case of bride burning, the mother-in-law of the victim was sentenced to life imprisonment, the Supreme Court refused to show any leniency on the ground that the accused mother-in-law had remained in jail for more than a decade. The Court observed that it would be a travesty of justice if sympathy was shown when a cruel act like bride burning is committed. It is rather strange that the mother-in-law who herself is a woman should resort to killing another woman. Undue sympathy would be harmful to the cause of justice.109. Where the accused himself killed his wife by burning and made his two children motherless, no lenient view could be taken on the ground that he had two children.110."

      "title": "Guidelines for sentencing policy.—",
      "content": "Currently, India does not have a structured sentencing guidelines that have been issued either by the legislature or the judiciary. However, the Courts have framed certain guidelines in the matter of imposition of sentence. The Courts will have to take into account certain principles while exercising their wide discretion in sentencing, such as proportionality, deterrence and rehabilitation. In a proportionality analysis, it is necessary to assess the seriousness of an offence in order to determine the commensurate punishment for the offender.112. Justice demands that Courts should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the Courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime.113. Law regulates social interests, arbitrates conflicting claims and demand. Undoubtedly, there is a cross-cultural conflict where living law must find answer to the new challenges and the Courts are required to mould the sentencing system to meet the challenges.114.\n\nThe principle governing the imposition of punishment will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. However, the sentence should be appropriate, adequate, just, proportionate and commensurate with the nature and gravity of the crime and the manner in which the crime is committed. The gravity of the crime, motive for the crime, nature of the crime and all other attending circumstances have to be borne in mind while imposing the sentence.115. An offence, which affects the morale of the society, should be severely dealt with. Socio-economic status, religion, race, caste or creed of the accused and the victim although may not be wholly irrelevant, should be eschewed in a case of this nature (abduction and rape of minor), particularly when Parliament itself has laid down minimum sentence.\nOne of the principles that the judiciary had all along kept in its mind that rape being a violation with violence of the private person of a woman causes mental scar, thus, not only a physical injury but also a deep sense of some deathless shame is also inflicted.116.\nThe Court cannot afford to be casual while imposing the sentence, inasmuch as both the crime and the criminal are equally important in the sentencing process. The Courts must see that the public does not lose confidence in the judicial system. Imposing inadequate sentences will do more harm to the justice system and may lead to a state where the victim loses confidence in the judicial system and resorts to private vengeance.117.\n6. Whipping.—This form of punishment is now abolished.\n\n7.

But, serving the society actually is not a punishment in the real sense where the convicts pay back to the community which he owes. Conduct of the convicts will not only be appreciated by the community, it will also give a lot of solace to him, especially in a case where because of one's action and inaction, human lives have been lost. In the facts and circumstances of the case, where six human lives were lost, Court felt to adopt this method would be good for the society rather than incarcerating the convict further in jail. The Court ordered to do community service for two years, which will be arranged by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment within two months. On default, the convict will have to undergo simple imprisonment for two years.121."

      "title": "Probation.—",
      "content": "Probation of Offenders Act, 1958 ('PO Act') is a milestone in the progress of the modern liberal trend of reform in the field of penology. It is the result of the recognition of the doctrine that the object of the criminal law is more to reform the individual offender than to punish him. Broadly stated that the PO Act distinguishes offenders below 21 years of age and those above that age, and offenders who are not guilty of having committed an offence punishable with death or that imprisonment for life and those who are guilty of a lesser offence. While in the case of offenders who are above the age of 21 years absolute discretion is given to the Court to release them after admonition or on probation of good conduct, subject to the conditions laid down in the appropriate provisions of the PO Act. In case of offender below the age of 21 years, an injunction is issued to the Court not to sentence them to imprisonment unless it is satisfied that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offenders, it is not desirable to deal with them under sections 3 and 4 of the PO Act.122. The PO Act introduced a very basic change in the criminal law of the country. At the same time, Courts were also to be careful about the impact on the society consequent on letting offenders on probation. Indiscriminate application of provisions of the PO Act to anti-social and white collar offenders may have an adverse effect on the security of the society. Application of the PO Act is specifically barred in some cases.123. Provisions of the PO Act should be applied having regard to the nature of offence and age, character and antecedents of the offender.124.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The stage for the exercise of this power generally speaking is post-judicial, i.e., after the judicial process has come to an end. After the judicial function ends, the executive function of giving effect to the judicial verdict commences. Constitutional power under Article 72/161 would override the statutory power contained in sections 432 and 433 and the limitation of section 433A of the Code as well as the power conferred by sections 54 and 55, IPC, 1860.129. No convict has a fundamental right of remission or shortening of sentence. The State in exercise of its executive power of remission must consider each individual case keeping in view the relevant factors. The power of the State to issue general instructions, so that no discrimination is made, is also permissible in law.130. Exercise of executive clemency is a matter of discretion and yet subject to certain standards. It is not a matter of privilege.131. A right to be considered for remission, keeping in view the constitutional safeguards of a convict under Articles 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India, must be held to be a legal one. Such a legal right emanates from not only the Prisons Act but also from the Rules framed thereunder.132. The power of remission vested in the Government under section 433A Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) is not in conflict with Articles 72 and 162 of the Constitution.133. Granting of pardon is in no sense an overturning of a judgment of conviction, but rather it is an executive action that mitigates or sets aside the punishment for a crime. It eliminates the effect of conviction without addressing the defendant's guilt or innocence.134. It is open to the President in the exercise of the power vested in him by Article 72 of the Constitution to scrutinize the evidence on the record of the criminal case and come to a different conclusion from that recorded by the Court in regard to the guilt of, and sentence imposed on, the accused.135."

      "content": "In TV Vatheeswaran's case, AIR 1983 SC 361 [LNIND 1983 SC 43] : 1983 SCR (2) 348136.\na two-Judge Bench of SC considered whether the accused, who was convicted for an offence of murder and sentenced to death, kept in solitary confinement for about eight years was entitled to commutation of death sentence. It was held that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.137. But a three-Judge in Sher Singh v State of Punjab,138. held that though prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is\n\nunquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be commuted, no hard and fast rule that \"delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death\" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran Javed Ahmed v State of Maharashtra,139. re-iterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran (supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-Judge Bench to overrule the Vatheeswaran Case. The conflicting views are finally settled by the Constitution Bench in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat.140. It overruled Vatheeswaran (supra) holding that undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned person to approach this Court under Article 32 but the Court will only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence was finally confirmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the Court while finally maintaining the sentence of death. Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the decision in Vatheeswaran case cannot be said to lay down the correct law. In Madhu Mehta v UOI,141.,142. Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that the mercy petition was pending for eight years after disposal of the criminal appeal by Supreme Court."

      "content": "In Devender Pal Singh Bhullar v State of NCT of Delhi,143. the convict appealed to the President for clemency in 2003. The President, after a lapse of over eight years, dismissed his mercy plea in 2011. Bhullar had sought commutation of his death penalty to life sentence by the Supreme Court on the ground that there was inordinate delay by the President over his plea for clemency. A two-Judge Bench144. by order dated 12 April 2013 dismissed his plea, by holding that the rule enunciated in Sher Singh's case (supra), Triveniben's case (supra) and some other judgments that long delay may be one of the grounds for commutation of the sentence of death into life imprisonment cannot be invoked in cases where a person is convicted for offence under TADA or similar statutes. Two weeks later in Mahendra Nath Das v UOI,145. the same Bench held that the convict's death sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment because much of the inordinate delay of 12 years in the rejection of his mercy petition by the President was unexplained, and therefore, inexcusable."

      "title": "Modification of death sentence to a particular period with the further direction that the convict must not be released from prison for the rest of his life or before actually serving out the term.—",
      "content": "It was in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v State of Karnataka,146. the three-Judge Bench held that there is a good and strong basis for the Court to substitute a death sentence by life imprisonment or by a term in excess of 14 years and further to direct that the convict must not be released from the prison for the rest of his life or for the actual term as specified in the order, as the case may be. But a two-Judge Bench in Sangeet v State of Haryana147. in which it was held that:\na reading of some recent decisions delivered by this Court seems to suggest that the remission power of the appropriate Government has effectively been nullified by awarding sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some cases without any remission. Is this permissible? Can this Court (or any Court for that matter) restrain the appropriate Government from granting remission of a sentence to a convict? What this Court has done\n\nin Swamy Shraddananda and several other cases, by giving a sentence in a capital offence of 20 years or 30 years imprisonment without remission, is to effectively injunct the appropriate Government from exercising its power of remission for the specified period. In our opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion, but as at present advised, we are of the opinion that this is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot be told that it is prohibited from granting remission of a sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be told that he cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever the reason. In this case, though the Division Bench raised a doubt about the decision of a three-Judge Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (supra), yet the same has not been referred to a larger Bench.\n\nIn Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jan v State of Rajasthan,148. another two-Judge Bench re- iterated the position held in Swamy Shraddananda (supra) by holding that the observations in Sangeet (supra) are not warranted. In Gurvail Singh @ Gala v State of Punjab,149. another two Judge also termed the remarks in Sangeet (supra) were 'unwarranted' and opined that if the two-Judge Bench was of the opinion that earlier judgments, even of a larger Bench were not justified, the Bench ought to have referred the matter to the larger Bench."

      "content": "In every case in which sentence of 164.[imprisonment] for life shall have been passed, 165.[the appropriate Government] may, without the consent of the offender, commute the punishment for imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding fourteen years.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nIn the absence of an order under section 55 IPC, 1860 or section 433(b) Cr PC, 1973 a life convict cannot be released even after expiry of 14 years, for a sentence of life imprisonment means rigorous imprisonment for the rest of convict's life.166. It is now conclusively settled by a catena of decisions that the punishment of imprisonment for life handed down by the Court means a sentence of imprisonment for the convict for the rest of his life.167. However, Supreme Court has been, for quite some time, conscious of the liberal approach and sometimes discriminatory too, taken by the States in exercise of their power under sections 432 and 433 of Cr PC, 1973 in remitting or commuting sentences. In Jagmohan Singh v State of UP,168. Court had expressed concern about such approach made by the States in remitting life sentences that led to the amendment in Cr PC introducing section 433A by Act 45 of 1978. Under section 433A of Cr PC, 1973 a sentence of imprisonment for life is imposed for an offence for which death is one of the punishments or where a death sentence is commuted to life under section 433, he shall not be released unless he has served 14 years of imprisonment.\nIt appears that the provision has been generally understood to mean that life sentence would only be 14 years of incarceration. Taking judicial notice of such a trend, the Supreme Court has, in cases where imposition of death sentence would be too harsh and imprisonment for life (the way it is understood as above) too inadequate, in several cases, has adopted different methods to ensure that the minimum term of life imprisonment ranges from at least 20 years to the end of natural life. However, in some cases, the Court had also been voicing concern about the statutory basis of such orders.169. In the case of State of Rajasthan v Jamil Khan,170. the Supreme Court opined that:\nWe are of the view that it will do well in case a proper amendment under section 53 of IPC is provided, introducing one more category of punishment - life imprisonment without commutation or remission. Dr. VS Malimath, J, in the Report on 'Committee of Reforms of Criminal Justice System', submitted in 2003, had made such a suggestion but so far no serious steps have been taken in that regard. There could be a provision for imprisonment till death without remission or commutation."

      "title": "The power of High Court to commute.—",
      "content": "Exercise of power under section 433 is an executive discretion. The High Court in exercise of its revisional jurisdiction had no power conferred on it to commute the sentence imposed where a minimum sentence was provided for offence. The mandate of section 433 Cr PC, 1973 enables the Government in an appropriate case to commute\n\nthe sentence of a convict and to prematurely order his release before expiry of the sentence as imposed by the Courts.171. In State (Govt. of NCT of Delhi) v Prem Raj,172. Supreme Court was called upon to consider whether in a case involving conviction under section 7 read with section 13(1)(d) of the Prevention of Corruption Act 1988, the High Court could commute the sentence of imprisonment on deposit of a specified amount by the convict and direct the State Government to pass appropriate order under section 433(c) Cr PC, 1973. It was held that the question of remission lay within the domain of the appropriate government and it was not open to the High Court to give a direction of that kind even if the High Court could give such a direction, it could only direct consideration of the case of premature release by the Government and could not have ordered the premature release of the respondent itself. The right to exercise the power under section 433 Cr PC, 1973 vests in the Government and has to be exercised by the Government in accordance with the rules and established principles. The impugned order of the High Court cannot, therefore, be sustained and is hereby set aside.173."

Parliament is the collective conscience of the people. If it has mandated a minimum sentence for certain offences, the Government being its delegate, cannot interfere with the same in exercise of their power for remission or commutation. Neither section 432 nor section 433 of Cr PC, 1973 hence contains a non-obstante provision. Therefore, the minimum sentence provided for any offence cannot be and shall not be remitted or commuted by the Government in exercise of their power under sections 432 or 433 of the Cr PC, 1973. Wherever the Indian Penal Code or such penal statutes have provided for a minimum sentence for any offence, to that extent, the power of remission or commutation has to be read as restricted; otherwise the whole purpose of punishment will be defeated and it will be a mockery on sentencing.174.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n164.

Section 57 is only for calculating fractions of terms of punishment and provides that imprisonment for life shall be reckoned as equivalent to imprisonment for 20 years. The object and purpose of section 57 will be clear by simply referring to sections 65, 116, 119, 129 and 511 of the IPC, 1860.179. The accused has thus no right to be released after a period of 20 years. The remissions granted under the rules made under the Prison Act or under the Jail Manual are merely administrative orders of the appropriate Government and fall exclusively within the discretion of the Government under section 401 (now section 432) Cr PC, 1973. In the case of a prisoner who is convicted in one State but transferred to the jail of another State to serve out the sentence, the appropriate Government to grant remission would be the Government of the State where the accused was convicted and not that of the transferee Government.180."

      "title": "Sentence of imprisonment for non-payment of fine.",
      "content": "191. [In every case, of an offence punishable with imprisonment as well as fine, 1 in which the offender is sentenced to a fine, whether with or without imprisonment, and in every case of an offence punishable 192.[with imprisonment or fine, or] with fine only, in which the offender is sentenced to a fine,] it shall be competent to the Court which sentences such offender to direct by the sentence that, in default of payment of the fine, the offender shall suffer imprisonment for a certain term, in which imprisonment shall be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may have been sentenced or to which he may be liable under a commutation of a sentence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe term of imprisonment in default of payment of fine is not a sentence. It is a penalty which a person incurs on account of non-payment of fine. The sentence is something which an offender must undergo unless it is set aside or remitted in part or in whole either in appeal or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings or \"otherwise\". A term of imprisonment ordered in default of payment of fine stands on a different footing. A person is required to undergo imprisonment either because he is unable to pay the amount of fine or refuses to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always avoid to undergo imprisonment in default of payment of fine by paying such amount. It is, therefore, not only the power, but also the duty of the Court to keep in view the nature of offence, circumstances under which it was committed, the position of the offender and other relevant considerations before ordering the offender to suffer imprisonment in default of payment of fine.193. A default sentence is no punishment under law. It is only a method of enforcement of the direction for payment of amounts directed to be paid as fine. Wherever the Criminal Court has the jurisdictional competence to impose a fine, sections 64–70, IPC, and section 30 Cr PC, 1973 stipulate that the Court can recover the same by imposition of a default sentence. The jurisdiction to impose a default sentence is only incidental to the power to impose a fine and the duty of the Court to recover the same.194. The wording of the section is not happy, but the Legislature intended by it to provide for the award of imprisonment in default of payment of fine in all cases in which fine can be imposed to induce the offender to pay the fine.\nThe cases falling under this section are:—\n\nWhere the offence is punishable with (a) imprisonment with fine, or (b) imprisonment or fine, or (c) fine only, and the offender is sentenced to (i) imprisonment, or (ii) fine, or both, the Court may sentence the offender to a term of imprisonment in default of payment of fine. A term of imprisonment for non-payment of fine is not a substantive sentence. It is only a penalty for the default. It cannot be added to the substantive sentence so as to see whether the maximum imprisonment that could be awarded for the offence is not being exceeded.195.\n1. 'Imprisonment as well as fine.'—Magistrates cannot award compensation in addition to fine.196.\n\nThe full Bench of Madras High Court held that imprisonment in default of payment of fine cannot be directed to run concurrently with substantive sentence because both the sentences are distinct in view of sections 53 and 64 IPC, 1860.197."

The only cases that it does not apply to are those dealt with in section 67 where fine only can be awarded.204. Section 33 (now 30) of the Cr PC, 1973 acts as a corollary to this section.

Thus, where the High Court altered the conviction of the appellant to one under section 419 read with section 109 IPC, from a conviction recorded by the trial Court under sections 420/511, 467, 468 and 471 read with section 120B IPC, and awarded a sentence of two years' rigorous imprisonment while maintaining the fine of Rs. 3,000 and by implication the default imprisonment of two years as awarded by the trial Court, it was held that, though the trial Court's order regarding two years' imprisonment in default of payment of fine was quite in order in view of the fact that the five offences for which the trial Court recorded a conviction were each punishable with seven years' imprisonment and the fine of Rs. 3,000 was only a part of the cumulative sentence for the commission of those five offences, yet the sentence of three years' imprisonment in default of payment of fine became illegal the moment the High Court altered the conviction to one under section 419 read with section 109 IPC, as under these sections the accused could be sentenced to a maximum of three years' imprisonment and, therefore, the default imprisonment could under no circumstance exceed nine months, that is, one-fourth of the maximum sentence of three years that could be awarded under section 419, IPC.205. While a Magistrate's powers are specifically limited by section 33(old) Cr PC they must also be exercised so as not to contravene section 65 IPC.206. Section 326, IPC is punishable with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine. However, because of section 29(2), Cr PC the learned Magistrate, First Class, cannot impose the maximum amount of imprisonment prescribed by this section; he also cannot, by resorting to section 65, IPC, award a period of imprisonment, in default of payment of fine, on the erroneous assumption that he has the power to award the maximum sentence prescribed by section 326, IPC.207. Section 65 IPC that puts a limit of imprisonment for default sentence upto one-fourth of the term of imprisonment, the grievance against higher default sentence, if any, can be only by the accused and not by the State.208.\n\n\n\n\n\n204.

Such imprisonment is not a discharge or satisfaction of the fine but is imposed as a punishment for non-payment or contempt or resistance to the due execution of the sentence. The offender cannot be permitted to choose whether he will suffer in his person or his property. His person will cease to be answerable for the fine. Nevertheless, his property will for a time continue to do so. The bar of six years may save the property of the accused but not his personal arrest. The liability for any sentence of imprisonment awarded in default of payment of fine continues after the expiration of six years.218. Any proceeding taken after six years to recover the fine by sale of immoveable property of the offender is time-barred.219. The limitation starts from the date of passing of the sentence of conviction by the trial Court and not the date of dismissal of the appeal or revision preferred by the accused.220. The property of the accused is liable for the payment of fine even if he has undergone imprisonment in default of fine and as such even on death of the offender does not discharge any property which would after his death, be legally liable for his debts due from him (including liability) to discharge the fine.221.\nThe expression \"levy\" in this section means \"to seize\" for the purpose of collecting the fine or to enforce execution for a certain sum and not actual realisation.222. Any stay or suspension obtained from the higher Court has to be excluded in computing the period of six years' limitation under section 70 IPC.223. Section 70 says that State shall levy fine within six years from the date of sentence. What is contemplated is that the State shall commence recovery proceedings within six years; and, need not be completed it within six years of the sentence. Therefore, once a distress warrant is issued within six years of the sentence, the plea of limitation is out of bounds for the sentence.224.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n218. Ganu Sakharam, (1884) Unrep.

[Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or\nwhere several acts, of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence, constitute, when combined, a different offence,\nthe offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of such offences.]\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A gives Z fifty strokes with a stick.

In order to attract provisions of Article 20(2) of the Constitution, i.e., doctrine of autrefois acquit or section 300 Cr PC, 1973 or section 71 IPC, 1860 or section 26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 ingredients of the offences in the earlier case as well as in the latter case must be the same and not different. The test to ascertain whether the two offences are the same is not identity of the allegations but the identity of the ingredients of the offence.228.\nThe rules for assessment of punishment are laid down in sections 71 and 72 of the IPC, 1860 and section 31 of the Cr PC, 1973. Section 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that when a person is convicted at one trial of two or more offences, the Court may, subject to the provisions of section 71 of the IPC, 1860, sentence him, for such offences, to the several punishments prescribed therefor which such Court is competent to inflict; and in the case of consecutive sentences, it shall not be necessary for the Court, by reason only of the aggregate punishment for the several offence being in excess of the punishment which it is competent to inflict on conviction of a single offences, to send the offender for trial before a higher Court. It, therefore, enhances the ordinary powers of sentences given to Magistrates by section 29, Cr PC, 1973; but in order to bring a case within the purview of this section, the accused must have been convicted of two or more offences in the same trial, and the sentence for any one of these offences should not exceed the limits of their ordinary powers. The limits fixed by this section refer to sentences passed simultaneously, or upon charges which are tried simultaneously. Sentences of imprisonment passed under it may run concurrently. When an accused is convicted at one trial of two or more offences, section 31(1) of Cr PC, 1973 vests discretion in Court to direct that punishment shall run concurrently. Court may sentence the accused for such offences to several punishments prescribed therefor, and such punishment would consist of imprisonment to commence, one after expiration of other in such order as the Court may direct, subject to limitation contained in section 71 of IPC, 1860.229."

But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating.\" It is to be noted that the whole beating is considered to constitute one offence while each of the blows also amounted to the offence of voluntarily causing hurt. It can be said, therefore, that while the obtaining of money by cheating on the presentation of an individual bill did constitute the offence of cheating the obtaining of the entire money in pursuance of the terms of the single contract and the single conspiracy entered into also constituted the offence of cheating. When the accused could not be punished with the punishment for more than one such offence it cannot be the intention of law that the accused be charged with each of the offences, which were in a way included in the complete offence made up by the entire course of conduct of the accused in pursuance of the conspiracy.230."

      "title": "Section 71 IPC and section 220 Cr PC.—",
      "content": "Section 71 of the IPC, 1860 has to be read in conjunction with section 220 of the Cr PC, 1973. It should, however, be remembered that section 220 Cr PC, 1973 contains only rules of criminal pleading in regard to joinder of charges and does not deal with the sentence to be passed on the charges of the offences mentioned in the several illustrations thereunder. Sub-section (5) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 makes this position abundantly clear. A joint reading of section 71 IPC, 1860 and section 220 Cr PC, 1973 clearly shows that clause (2) of section 71 IPC, 1860 approximates sub-section (3) of\n\nsection 220 Cr PC, 1973 and clause (3) of section 71 IPC, 1860 corresponds to sub- section (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973. It, therefore, follows that the embargo on separate sentence under section 71 IPC, 1860 applies only to cases falling within sub- sections (3) and (4) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 and not under, for example, sub-section\n(1) of that section.231. Thus in cases covered by illustrations (i), (j) and (k) to sub- section (3) and illustration (m) to sub-section (4) of section 220 Cr PC, though the offences mentioned therein could be tried together and conviction recorded in regard to each one of them, yet no separate sentences could be passed in view of the embargo contained in section 71 IPC, 1860. Similarly, where the accused was convicted and sentenced under section 147 IPC, 1860 a separate sentence under section 143 IPC, 1860 could not be passed.232. In the same way when an accused is convicted for a more serious offence, e.g., under section 148 IPC, 1860 a separate sentence under section 147 IPC, 1860 is not only uncalled for but illegal.233. It, therefore, means that cases falling under sub-section (1) of section 220 Cr PC, 1973 where several distinct offences are committed in course of the same transaction, the accused cannot only be tried and convicted of all of them at one trial but even separate sentences can be passed in regard to each one of them. Thus, where a person commits lurking house-trespass by night (section 457 IPC, 1860) and also commits theft (section 380 IPC, 1860) in course of the same transaction, he can be convicted and sentenced separately for both of them.234. Though the offence under section 420, IPC, 1860 and offence under section 138, N.I. Act are very distinct and their ingredients are different, still both the offences were committed during the same transaction; accused could have been charged and tried for both the offences during single trial as per section 220, Cr PC, 1973. However, from the language of section 220, it appears to be enabling provision whereby two or more different offences may be tried together by the Court and not mandatory.235."

The case is not covered either by section 71 of the IPC, 1860 or by section 26 of the General Clauses Act, and the punishment for the two offences cannot be limited under those sections. But, normally, no Court should award two separate punishments for the same act constituting two offences under section 201. The appropriate sentence under section 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 330 to disappear should be passed, and no separate sentence need be passed under section 201 for causing the evidence of the offence under section 348 to disappear.236.

When the offences are separate and distinct and do not constitute parts of one offence, the accused can be convicted separately for each one of the offences. Therefore, the argument that the sentence both under sections 148 and 324, IPC is opposed to section 71, IPC is not acceptable.238.\n\nThe provisions of section 31 of the Code of Criminal Procedure have to be read subject to the provisions of this section and that where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, the offender shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for anyone of such offences.239.\n3. Same facts constituting different offences.—It has been held that although the act of the petitioner is only one, namely plying of overloaded vehicle on the public road, he had committed two distinct offences punishable under two different enactments, namely (i) violation of the terms of permit and certificate of registration granted by the authorities which is punishable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and (ii) causing damage to the public property which is punishable under the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984. Hence, the claim of the petitioner that he is being punished more than once for the same offence violating Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India is neither factually correct nor legally tenable as he is being proceeded against for two distinct offences punishable under two separate Acts and no parallel procedure for the same offence is being adopted.240. Prosecution under sections 5 and 6 of Rajasthan Sati (Prevention) Act 1987 not barred since section 5 makes the commission of an act an offence and punishes the same while the provisions of section 6 are preventive in nature and make provision for punishing contravention of prohibitory order so as to make the prevention effective. The two offences have different ingredients.241.\n4. An act giving rise to an offence and an aggravated form of the same offence.— Section 457 makes punishable lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by night in order to the committing of any offence punishable with imprisonment and if the offence intended to be committed is theft, the punishment is higher. Section 380 makes punishable a theft committed in a dwelling house. The two offences do not, in our opinion, fall under section 71 and, therefore, the conviction under both the sections is not illegal.242.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n225.

It is inflicted in order that a feeling of loneliness may produce wholesome influence and reform the criminal. This section gives the scale according to which solitary confinement may be inflicted. Where the petitioner, an undertrial prisoner, who was arrested in connection with the assassination of a former Prime Minister was put in a separate cell only as a precautionary measure, to ensure his non-mingling with other prisoners and for his security, it was held that it did not amount either to solitary confinement or cellular confinement.245. The well-known principle of law is that the convict carrying death punishment is not deemed to be 'prisoner under sentence of death' unless death sentence becomes final, conclusive and beyond judicial scrutiny. Such convict is handed over to the jail authority to be kept in safe and protected custody with purpose that he may be available for execution of the sentence eventually confirmed. This custody is different from custody of a convict suffering from simple or rigorous imprisonment. Therefore, he cannot be kept in Cell or solitary confinement which itself is a separate punishment.246."

[***]\n\nshall be guilty of any offence punishable under either of those Chapters with like imprisonment for the like term, shall be subject for every such subsequent offence to 256.[imprisonment for life], or to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years.]\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nPrinciple.—This section does not constitute a separate offence but only imposes a liability to enhanced punishment. What section 75 IPC, 1860 contemplates is that where a person who has been, previously convicted of an offence punishable under Chapter XII (which deals with offences relating to coin and Government stamps) or Chapter XVII. (which relates to offences against property) with imprisonment of either description for a term of three years or up-wards, is once again found guilty of a similar offence, he shall be liable to enhanced punishment which may extend to imprisonment for life or to imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years. The section is concerned with a previous conviction for a similar offence but it does not postulate that in respect of the previous conviction, the punishment imposed should have been one of not less than three years. All that it posits is that the previous conviction should have been in respect of an offence punishable with a term of imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards, but it does not lay down that the offender should have been actually punished with such a term of imprisonment.257. It does not apply to offences under other Acts.258.\n1. 'Having been convicted'.—A plain reading of this provision goes to show that the previous conviction ought to be for offence punishable under Chapter XII or Chapter XVII and the sentence imposed is three years or more than that. If the sentence is less than three years or the offence does not fall within any of the two Chapters then section 75, IPC, 1860 would not be applicable. If any authority is required then reference may be made to Re Kamya,259. wherein it has been held that the minimum required for enhancement of punishment under section 75, IPC, 1860 is that the previous conviction of the accused should have resulted in punishment of three years or more.260. Section 75 is invoked for enhancement of the sentence and that can come only at the time the sentence is to be imposed. The fact that the accused is an old offender is not to be taken note of by the Court at the trial. Only at the conclusion of the\n\ntrial after entering the conviction, that question can be taken up for imposing the sentence.261. Simply because the provisions of section 75 of the Indian Penal Code are attracted in a particular case, is no ground for inflicting the extreme punishment provided in that section. The provisions of this section are only permissive and not obligatory. They do confer jurisdiction on the Courts to inflict enhanced punishment but then that jurisdiction is to be exercised in a judicial manner after taking into consideration the circumstances and the factors narrated above.262. Section 75, IPC, 1860 does not prescribe that a severe sentence should be imposed for repetition of any crime by an offender. It does not prescribe a minimum sentence for any event. It does not say that a convict of a petty theft committed without any violence should be given a severe sentence if he had half a dozen previous convictions for like offences to his credit.263."

      "title": "Clause (a).—",
      "content": "For the application of this section it is not necessary to show that the previous sentence was for three years or upwards. What is required is that the previous conviction was for an offence punishable under Chapter XII or XVII, for which sentence of imprisonment could have been three years or upwards. The key word being \"punishable\" the actual sentence awarded for the first offence is not of any consequence so long the offence was punishable with imprisonment for three years or upwards.264. It is also necessary to remember that the conviction for the earlier offence must remain in operation on the date of conviction for second offence. Thus if the previous conviction is set aside on appeal, the accused cannot be awarded enhanced punishment under this section.265. Non-applicability of section 75, IPC has nothing to do with the proof or guilt of the main offence. If section 75, IPC is found to be inapplicable then it would not mean that the finding of guilt for certain offences recorded by the Magistrate will also go away. The conviction for the offences would stand and the accused would be liable to be sentenced for the main offence and the sentence cannot be enhanced with the aid of section 75, IPC, 1860.266."

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

A has committed no offence.\n\n(b) A, an officer of a Court of Justice, being ordered by that Court to arrest Y, and, after due enquiry, believing Z to be Y, arrests Z. A has committed no offence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nSections 76 and 79 are based on the maxim ignorantia facti doth excusat and ignorantia juris non excusat. Section 76 excuses a person who has done what by law is an offence, under a misconception of facts, leading him to believe in good faith that he was commanded by law to do it. See Comment on section 79, infra.\nThis section and sections 77, 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person bound or justified by law. This section as well as sections 78 and 79 deal with acts of a person under a mistake.\n1. 'Mistake of fact'.—See Comment under section 79, infra.\n\n2. 'Mistake of law'.—See Comment under section 79, infra.\n\n3. 'In good faith believes himself to be, bound by law'.—In order to entitle a person to claim the benefit of this section it is necessary to show the existence of a state of facts which would justify the belief in good faith, interpreting the latter expression with reference to section 52, that the person to whom the order was given was bound by law to obey it. Thus, in the case of a soldier, the Penal Code does not recognize the mere duty of blind obedience to the commands of a superior as sufficient to protect him from the penal consequences of his act. But in certain circumstances a soldier receives absolute protection under section 132 of the Cr PC, 1973.\nFor illegal acts, however, neither the orders of a parent nor a master nor a superior will furnish any defence. Nothing but fear of instant death is a defence for a policeman who tortures anyone by order of a superior. The maxim respondeat superior has no application to such a case.6. The net position appears to be that if superior order is in conformity with the law no further question arises and the subordinate officer is protected by section 76 IPC, 1860, if he carries out that order. It is only when the order is not in accordance with the law but the subordinate officer who carries out that order in good faith, on account of a mistake of fact and not on ground of mistake of law, believes himself to be bound by law to carry out such an order, that a further question arises as to whether the subordinate officer will not still get protection of section 76 IPC, 1860, because of his mistake of fact. Thus, where the order was legal in the circumstances of the case, e.g., where the police patrol party opened fire under the order of the Deputy Commissioner of Police after it had been attacked on a dark night and an Assistant Commissioner of Police had been injured as a result of such attack, really no question arose for the application of section 76 IPC, 1860, as the order was both legal and justified by the circumstances of the case.7. The Indian law as contained in sections 76 and 79 of the Penal Code appears to be the same as in England. This point has, however, not been clearly decided in any case including the decision of the Supreme Court in Shew Mangal Singh's case.8. There are, however, enough indications\n\nin Shew Mangal Singh's case and in sections 76 and 79 IPC, 1860, that if the subordinate due to a mistake of fact and not due to a mistake of law honestly believed that he was bound or justified by law in carrying out the superior order which though not manifestly illegal was nevertheless illegal, perhaps he would still get the benefit of superior order. Obedience to an illegal order can only be used in mitigation of punishment but cannot be used as a complete defence.9. If on account of any abnormal reaction, the employee has committed suicide, the conduct of the complainant or of higher officer of taking departmental action by way of resorting to legal remedy or enforcement of law, cannot be termed as leaving no option to the delinquent employee but to commit suicide and, therefore, cannot be said as abetment or incitement to suicide under such circumstances. In any case any action for resorting to legal remedy for grievances or for enforcement of law in exercise of powers or purported exercise of power cannot be said to contain any element of criminality unless such action is ex facie without any competence, authority or jurisdiction.10."

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8.

Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14.

      "title": "Act done by a person justified or by mistake of fact believing himself justified, by law.",
      "content": "Nothing is an offence which is done by any person who is justified by law1, or who by reason of a mistake of fact2 and not by reason of a mistake of law3 in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law, in doing it.\n\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA sees Z commit what appears to A to be a murder. A, in the exercise, to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith, of the power which the law gives to all persons of apprehending murderers in the fact, seizes Z, in order to bring Z before the proper authorities. A has committed no offence, though it may turn out that Z was acting in self-defence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nDistinction between Sections 76 and 79.—The distinction between section 76 and this section is that in the former a person is assumed to be bound, and in the latter to be justified, by law; in other words, the distinction is between a real or supposed legal obligation and a real or supposed legal justification, in doing the particular act. Under both (these sections) there must be a bona fide intention to advance the law, manifested by the circumstances attending the act which is the subject of charge; and the party accused cannot allege generally that he had a good motive, but must allege specifically that he believed in good faith that he was bound by law (section 76) to do as he did, or that being empowered by law (section 79) to act in the matter, he had acted to the best of his judgment exerted in good faith.14.\n1. Any person who is justified by law.—Jurisprudentially viewed, an act may be an offence, definitionally speaking but a forbidden act may not spell inevitable guilt if the law itself declares that in certain special circumstances it is not to be regarded as an offence. The chapter on General Exceptions operates in this province. Section 79 makes an offence a non-offence. When? Only when the offending act is actually justified by law or is bona fide believed by mistake of fact to be so justified.15. It is easy to see that if the act complained of is wholly justified by law, it would not amount to an offence at all in view of the provisions of section 79 of the IPC, 1860. Many cases may however arise wherein acting under the provisions of the Police Act or other law conferring powers on the police, the police officer or some other person may go beyond what is strictly justified in law. Though section 79 of the IPC, 1860 will have no application to such cases, section 53 of the Police Act will apply. But section 53 applies to only a limited class of persons. So, it becomes the task of the Court, whenever any question whether this section applies or not arises to bestow particular care on its decision. In doing this it has to ascertain first, what act is complained of and then to examine, if there is any provision of the Police Act or other law conferring powers on the police, under which it may be said to have been done or intended to be done. The Court has to remember in this connection that an act is not \"under\" a provision of law merely because the point of time at which it is done coincides with the point of time when some act is done in the exercise of the powers granted by the provision or in performance of the duty imposed by it. To be able to say that an act is done \"under\" a provision of law, one must discover the existence of a reasonable relationship between the provisions and the act. In the absence of such a relation the act cannot be said to be done \"under\" the particular provision of law.16. But unless there is a reasonable connection between the act complained of and the powers and duties of the office, it cannot be said that the act was done by the accused officer under the colour of his office.17. In Bhanuprasad Hariprasad Dave's case,18. wherein the allegations against the police officer was of taking advantage of his position and attempting to coerce a person to give him a bribe. The plea of colour of duty was negatived by the Supreme Court. In Prof. Sumer Chand v UOI, 1994 (1) SCC 64 [LNIND 1993 SC 665] Supreme Court on facts endorsed the opinion of the High Court that the act of the Police Officer complained of fell within the description of `colour of duty'. The argument is irresistible that if the performance of the act which constitutes the offence is justified by law, i.e.,\n\nby some other provision, then section 79 exonerates the doer because the act ceases to be an offence. Likewise, if the act were done by one 'who by reason of a mistake of fact in good faith believes himself to be justified by law in doing it' then also, the exception operates and the bona fide belief, although mistaken, eliminates the culpability. If the offender can irrefutably establish that he is actually justified by law in doing the act or, alternatively, that he entertained a mistake of fact and in good faith believed that he was justified by law in committing the act, then, the weapon of section 79 demolishes the prosecution.19.\n2. 'Mistake of fact'.—Under this section, although an act may not be justified by law, yet if it is done under a mistake of fact, in the belief in good faith that it is justified by law it will not be an offence. Such cases are not uncommon where the Courts in the facts and circumstances of the particular case have exonerated the accused under section 79 on the ground of having acted in good faith under the belief, owing to a mistake of fact that he was justified in doing the act which constituted an offence. As laid down in section 52 of the IPC, 1860, nothing is said to be done or believed in good faith which is done or believed without due care and attention. The question of good faith must be considered with reference to the position of the accused and the circumstances under which he acted. 'Good faith' requires not logical infallibility but due care and attention. The question of good faith is always a question of fact to be determined in accordance with the proved facts and circumstances of each case.20.\n'Mistake' is not mere forgetfulness.21. It is a slip \"made, not by design, but by mischance.\"22. Under sections 76 and 79 a mistake must be one of fact and not of law. At common law an honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which a prisoner is indicted an innocent act has always been held to be a good defence. Honest and reasonable mistake stands in fact on the same footing as absence of the reasoning faculty, as in infancy, or perversion of that faculty, as in lunacy.23. It may be laid down as a general rule that an alleged offender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he in good faith and on reasonable grounds believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence.24. Ignorantia facti doth excusat, for such ignorance many times makes the act itself morally involuntary.25. Where a man made a thrust with a sword at a place where, upon reasonable grounds, he supposed a burglar to be, and killed a person who was not a burglar, it was held that he had committed no offence.26. In other words, he was in the same situation as far as regards the homicide as if he had killed a burglar. The accused while guarding his maize field shot an arrow at a moving object in the bona fide belief that it was a bear and in the process caused the death of a man who was hiding there. It was held that he could not be held liable for murder as his case was fully covered by section 79 as well as section 80 IPC, 1860.27. Similarly, where the accused while helping the police stopped a cart which they in good faith believed to be carrying smuggled rice but ultimately their suspicion proved to be incorrect, it was held that they could not be prosecuted for wrongful restraint under section 341 as their case was covered by section 79 IPC, 1860.28. Section 79 makes an offence a non-offence. Thus, where the Board of Censors, acting within their jurisdiction and on an application made and pursued in good faith sanctions the public exhibition of a film, the producer and the connected agencies do enter the statutory harbour and are protected from prosecution under section 292 IPC, 1860, because section 79 of the Code exonerates them at least in view of their bona fide belief that the certificate is justificatory.29.\n\n3. 'Mistake of law'.—Mistake in point of law in a criminal case is no defence. Mistake of law ordinarily means mistake as to the existence or otherwise of any law on a relevant subject as well as mistake as to what the law is.30.\nIgnorance of the municipal law of the Kingdom, or of the penalty thereby inflicted upon offenders, doth not excuse any, that is of the age of discretion and compos mentis, from the\n\npenalty of the breach of it; because every person of the age of discretion and compos mentis is bound to know the law, and presumed so to do.31.\n\nIf any individual should infringe the statute law of the country through ignorance or carelessness, he must abide by the consequences of his error; it is not competent to him to aver in a Court of Justice that he was ignorant of the law of the land, and no Court of Justice is at liberty to receive such a plea.32.\nThe maxim ignorantia juris non excusat, in its application to criminal offences, admits of no exception, not even in the case of a foreigner who cannot reasonably be supposed in fact to know the law of the land.33. The legal presumption that everyone knows the law of the land is often untrue as a matter of fact. But then why such a presumption subsists? The reason for this seems to be nothing but expediency; otherwise there is no knowing of the extent to which the excuse of ignorance of law might be carried. Indeed, it might be urged almost in every case.34. This rule of expediency has been put to use even in a case where the accused could not have possibly known the law in the circumstances in which he was placed. Thus, a person who was on the high seas and as such could not have been cognizant of a recently passed law might be convicted for contravening it.35.\n\nWhenever the question of justification of an offence either due to mistake of fact or mistake of law arises, the guiding rules are: (1) that when an act is in itself plainly criminal, and is more severely punishable if certain circumstances co-exist, ignorance of the existence of such circumstances is no answer to a charge for the aggravated offence. (2) That where an act is prima facie innocent and proper, unless certain circumstances co-exist, then ignorance of such circumstances is an answer to the charge. (3) That the state of the defendant's mind must amount to absolute ignorance of the existence of the circumstance which alters the character of the act, or to a belief in its non-existence. (4) Where an act which is in itself wrong is, under certain circumstances, criminal, a person who does the wrong act cannot set up as a defence that he was ignorant of the facts which turned the wrong into a crime. (5) Where a statute makes it penal to do an act under certain circumstances, it is a question upon the wording and object of the particular statute, whether the responsibility of ascertaining that the circumstances exist is thrown upon the person who does the act or not. In the former case his knowledge is immaterial.36."

The doctrine as to acts of State can apply only to acts which affect foreigners, and which are done by the orders or with the ratification of the Government. As between the State and its subjects there can be\n\nno such thing as an act of State. Courts of law are established for the express purpose of limiting public authority in its conduct towards individuals.\nPersons carrying out an act of State under proper orders will be protected by the Penal Code, in the same way as if they were carrying out a lawful order under the municipal law. To support a plea of this nature two things are essential:—\n\n(1) that the defendant had authority to act on behalf of the State in the matter; and\n(2) that in so acting, he was professing to act as a matter of policy, outside the law, and not as a matter of right within the law."

A police-officer saw a horse tied up in B's premises and because it happened to resemble one which his father had lost a short time previously, he jumped at once to the conclusion that B had either stolen the horse himself, or purchased it from the thief, and compelled B to account for his possession. The officer found that B had bought the animal from one S; so he sent for S, charged him with the theft, and compelled him to give bail whilst an investigation was pending. The officer never sent for the supposed owner of the horse, or took the trouble of getting any credible information as to whether it was his father's horse or not. It was held that the police-officer had not acted in good faith, that is, with due care and attention and that this section did not protect him.45. The accused struck a person with a full force lathi blow thinking that he was a thief and he had to do so to safeguard his property. The incident took place outside the house near a pond. The place was away from the house. There being no occasion for private defence of property and the blow being given on the head with severity, it was held that the accused was liable to be convicted under section 304 Part\nII.

Prince, (1875) LR 2 CCR 154.\n\nTHE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n\nCHAPTER IV GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\nTHIS chapter has been framed in order to obviate the necessity of repeating in every penal clause a considerable number of limitations.\nThe word 'offence' in this chapter denotes a thing punishable under the Code or under any special or local law when it satisfied the conditions laid down in section 40 of the Code.\nThe \"general exceptions\" contained in sections 76–106 make an offence a non-offence. The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

Here, if there was no want of proper caution on the part of A, his act is excusable and not an offence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section exempts the doer of an innocent or lawful act in an innocent or lawful manner and without any criminal intention or knowledge from any unforeseen evil result that may ensue from accident or misfortune.48. To claim the benefit of this provision it has to be shown:\n\n(1) that the act in question was without any criminal intention or knowledge;\n(2) that the act was being done in a lawful manner by lawful means; and\n(3) that act was being done with proper care and caution.49.\n\n1. 'Accident'.—An effect is said to be accidental when the act by which it is caused is not done with the intention of causing it, and when its occurrence as a consequence of such act is not so probable that a person of ordinary prudence ought, under the circumstances in which it is done, to take reasonable precautions against it.50. An accident is something that happens out of the ordinary course of things.51. The idea of something fortuitous and unexpected is involved in the word 'accident.'52. Where two brothers were sleeping together and one of them while in a state of semi-sleep felt that somebody was throttling him, picked up the dao, kept on the head of the bed, and administered a blow which was received by his sleeping brother who died, there being neither intention nor motive, the accused was let off under this section. His act was not voluntary.53.\n\nAn injury is said to be accidentally caused whensoever it is neither wilfully nor negligently caused.54. Where the accused fired a shot at his assailant who escaped but four other persons were injured and one of them unfortunately expired, it was held that the accused was not liable for the fatal injury to an innocent person as his case fell within the scope of section 80 read with sections 96 and 100, IPC, 1860.55. Shooting with an unlicensed gun does not debar an accused from claiming immunity under this section.56."

      "title": "Medical Negligence.—",
      "content": "To prosecute a medical professional for negligence under criminal law it must be shown that the accused did something or failed to do something which in the given facts and circumstances no medical professional in his ordinary senses and prudence would have done or failed to do. The hazard taken by the accused doctor should be of such a nature that the injury which resulted was most likely imminent.57. In Dr. Suresh Gupta v Govt. of NCT of Delhi,58. the Apex Court held that where the medical practitioner failed to take appropriate steps, viz., \"not putting a cuffed endotracheal tube of proper size\" so as to prevent aspiration of blood blocking respiratory passage, the act attributed to him may be described as negligent act but not so reckless as to make him criminally liable. In Kusum Sharma v Batra Hospital and Medical Research Centre,59. the Supreme Court reiterated the legal position after taking survey of catena of case law. In the context of issue pertaining to criminal liability of a medical practitioner, it is laid\n\ndown that the prosecution of a medical practitioner would be liable to be quashed if the evidence on record does not project substratum enough to infer gross or excessive degree of negligence on his/her part. The criminal liability cannot be fastened on the Medical Practitioner unless the negligence is so obvious and of such high degree that it would be culpable by applying the settled norms.60."

Offending vehicle became free and was out of control. Incident was merely an accident and not an act of rashness or negligence on the part of the accused.61. Where the act of the accused is itself of criminal nature, the protection of this section cannot be availed. In this case, the accused picked up his gun, unlocked it, loaded it with cartridges, aimed at the chest of the victim from a close range of 4–5 feet and shot it. Quite naturally this section was held to be not applicable. There could be no suggestion of an accident.62. Where the Death is caused by shooting an arrow under bona fide belief that object aimed at was an animal, accused is entitled to the benefit under sections 79 or 80.63. The accused was attacked when he was asleep at night by his brother who tried to strangulate him. Apprehending imminent death, the accused aimed a blow at his assailant brother with a piece of bamboo on which he could lay hand and the blow accidentally struck the head of his intervening father as a result of which he ultimately died. It was held that the accused exercised his lawful right of self- defence and the blow fell on the head of his father by accident and misfortune and he was fully protected by sections 80 and\n106. His conviction under section 304 Part II was set aside.64."

      "content": "The prosecution alleges that the accused intentionally shot the deceased; but the accused pleads that, though the shots emanated from his revolver and hit the deceased, it was by accident, that is, the shots went off from the revolver in the course of a struggle in the circumstances mentioned in section 80 of the IPC, 1860 and hit the deceased resulting in his death. The Court then shall presume the absence of circumstances bringing the case within the provisions of section 80 of the IPC, 1860, that is, it shall presume that the shooting was not by accident, and that the other circumstances bringing the case within the exception did not exist. But this presumption may be rebutted by the accused by adducing evidence to support his plea of accident in the circumstances mentioned therein. This presumption may also be rebutted by admissions made or circumstances elicited by the evidence led by the prosecution or by the combined effect of such circumstances and the evidence adduced by the accused. But the section does not in any way affect the burden that lies on the prosecution to prove all the ingredients of the offence with which the accused is charged and that burden never shifts.65.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

      "title": "Act likely to cause harm, but done without criminal intent, and to prevent other harm.",
      "content": "Nothing is an offence merely by reason of its being done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm, if it be done without any criminal intention1 to cause harm, and\n\nin good faith for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property.\nExplanation.—It is a question of fact in such a case whether the harm to be prevented or avoided was of such a nature and so imminent as to justify or excuse the risk of doing the act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause harm.\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A, the captain of a steam vessel, suddenly and without any fault or negligence on his part, finds himself in such a position that, before he can stop his vessel, he must inevitably run down a boat B, with twenty or thirty passengers on board, unless he changes the course of his vessel, and that, by changing his course, he must incur risk of running down a boat C with only two passengers on board, which he may possibly clear. Here, if A alters his course without any intention to run down the boat C and in good faith for the purpose of avoiding the danger to the passengers in the boat B, he is not guilty of an offence, though he may run down the boat C by doing an act which he knew was likely to cause that effect, if it be found as a matter of fact that the danger which he intended to avoid was such as to excuse him in incurring the risk of running down the boat C.\n\n(b) A, in a great fire, pulls down houses in order to prevent the conflagration from spreading. He does this with the intention in good faith of saving human life or property. Here, if it be found that the harm to be prevented was of such a nature and so imminent as to excuse A's act. A is not guilty of the offence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nAn act which would otherwise be a crime may in some cases be excused if the person accused can show that it was done only in order to avoid consequences which could not otherwise be avoided, and which, if they had followed, would have inflicted upon him or upon others whom he was bound to protect inevitable and irreparable evil, that no more was done than was reasonably necessary for that purpose, and that the evil inflicted by it was not disproportionate to the evil avoided.66. As in self-defence so in the prevention of harm the accused is faced with two choices both resulting in some harm and of sheer necessity to avoid a greater harm he has to commit an act which would otherwise be an offence. The test really is like this: there must be a situation in which the accused is confronted with a grave danger and he has no choice but to commit the lesser harm may be even to an innocent person, in order to avoid the greater harm. Here the choice is between the two evils and the accused rightly chooses the lesser one.67.\n1. 'Without any criminal intention'.—Under no circumstances can a person be justified in intentionally causing harm; but if he causes the harm without any criminal intention, and merely with the knowledge that it is likely to ensue, he will not be held responsible for the result of his act, provided it be done in good faith to avoid or prevent other harm to person or property.\n'Criminal intention' simply means the purpose of design or doing an act forbidden by the criminal law without just cause or excuse. An act is intentional if it exists in idea before it exists in fact, the idea realizing itself in the fact because of the desire by which it is accompanied. The motive for an act is not a sufficient test to determine its criminal character. By a motive is meant anything that can contribute to give birth to, or even to\n\nprevent, any kind of action. Motive may serve as a clue to the intention; but although the motive is pure, the act done under it may be criminal. Purity of motive will not purge an act of its criminal character.\nWhere an offence depends upon proof of intention the Court must have proof of facts sufficient to justify in coming to the conclusion that the intention existed. No doubt one has usually to infer intention from conduct, and one matter that has to be taken into account is the probable effect of the conduct. But that is never conclusive.68.\nWhere the positive evidence against the accused is clear, cogent and reliable, the question of motive is of no importance.69."

      "title": "Mens rea.—",
      "content": "It is a well settled principle of common law that mens rea is an essential ingredient of criminal offence. A statute can exclude that element, but it is a sound rule of construction adopted in England and also accepted in India to construe a statutory provision creating an offence in conformity with the common law rather than against it unless the statute expressly or by necessary implication excludes mens rea. There is a presumption that mens rea is an essential ingredient of a statutory offence; but this may be rebutted by the express words of a statute creating the offence or by necessary implication. But the mere fact that the object of a statute is to promote welfare activities or to eradicate grave social evils is in itself not decisive of the question whether the element of guilty mind is excluded from the ingredients of the offence. It is also necessary to enquire whether a statute by putting a person under strict liability helps him to assist the State in the enforcement of the law; can he do anything to promote the observance of the law? Mens rea by necessary implication can be excluded from a statute only where it is absolutely clear that the implementation of the object of a statute would otherwise be defeated and its exclusion enables those put under strict liability by their act or omission to assist the promotion of the law. The nature of mens rea that will be implied in a statute creating an offence depends upon the object of the Act and the provisions thereof.70.\nIt is, however, held that mens rea is an essential ingredient in every offence except in three cases:\n\n(1) cases not criminal in any real sense but which in the public interest are prohibited under a penalty;\n(2) public nuisance; and\n(3) cases criminal in form but which are really only a summary mode of enforcing a civil right.\nThe maxim actus non facit reum, nisi mens sit rea has, however, no application in its technical sense to the offences under the Penal Code, as the definitions of various offences contain expressly a proposition as to the state of mind of the accused. In other words, each offence under the Code except offences like waging war (section 121), sedition (section 124A), kidnapping and abduction (sections 359, 363) and counterfeiting coins (section 232) prescribes a mens rea of a specific kind which is not exactly the same as mens rea in the sense of being a guilty mind under the common law. Thus, throughout the web of the IPC, 1860 the doctrine of mens rea runs as a running thread in the form of \"intentionally\", \"voluntarily\", \"knowingly\", \"fraudulently\", \"dishonestly\" and the like. It is, therefore, not entirely correct to say that the doctrine of mens rea is inapplicable to the offence under the Penal Code. What the Code requires is not negation of mens rea but mens rea of a specific kind and this may differ from offence-to-offence.\n\nIn this section and in sections 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 95, 100, 104 and 106, 'harm' can only mean physical injury.71.\nAs to the doctrine of compulsion and necessity, see comment on section 94, infra."

At the trial of an indictment for murder it appeared that the prisoners D and S, seamen, and the deceased, a boy between 17 and 18, were cast away in a storm on the high seas, and compelled to put into an open boat; that the boat was drifting on the ocean and was probably more than 1,000 miles from land; that on the 18th day, when they had been seven days without food and five days without water, D proposed to S that lots should be cast who should be put to death to save the rest, and that they afterwards thought it would be better to kill the boy that their lives should be saved; that on the 20th day, D with the assent of S, killed the boy, and both D and S fed on his flesh for four days; that at the time of the act there was no sail in sight nor any reasonable prospect of relief; that under these circumstances there appeared to the prisoners every probability that unless they then or very soon fed upon the boy, or one of themselves, they would die of starvation. It was held that upon these facts there was no proof of any such necessity as could justify the prisoners in killing the boy, and that they were guilty of murder.75. A and B, swimming in the sea after shipwreck, get hold of a plank not large enough to support both; A pushes off B, who is drowned. This, in the opinion of Sir James Stephen, is not a crime as A thereby does B no direct bodily harm but leaves him to his chance of getting another plank. According to Archbold this is not a law now. In R v Martin,76. the defendant, charged with driving whilst disqualified, sought to raise necessity as a defence but on the trial judge ruling, in effect, that necessity was no defence to an 'absolute' offence, he changed his plea to guilty. The circumstances on which the defendant sought to rely were that his wife's son (the defendant's stepson) was late for work and accordingly in danger of losing his job, and that this had made his wife so distraught that she threatened to commit suicide unless he drove her son to work. There was medical evidence available indicating that it was likely that his wife would have attempted suicide had he not driven her son to work.

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

      "content": "Nothing is an offence which is done by a child above seven years of age and under twelve, who has not attained suﬃcient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct on that occasion.\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nWhere the accused is a child above seven years of age and under twelve, the incapacity to commit an offence only arises when the child has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct, and such non- attainment would have apparently to be specially pleaded and proved, like the incapacity of a person who, at the time of doing an act charged as an offence, was alleged to have been of unsound mind under this section it has got to be shown that the accused is not only under 12 but has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding. If no evidence or circumstance is brought to the notice of the Court, it will be presumed that the child accused intended to do what he really did. Thus, where a child of 12 or so used a sharp sword in killing a person along with his two brothers and no evidence either of age or immaturity of understanding was led on his behalf, it was held that he committed an offence at least under section 326, IPC, 1860.81. The Legislature is manifestly referring in this section to an exceptional immaturity of intellect.82. What the section contemplates is that the child should not know the nature and physical consequences of his conduct.83. The circumstances of a case may disclose such a degree of malice as to justify the maxim malitia supplet octatem.84. Where the accused, a boy over 11 years but below 12 years of age, picked up his knife and advanced towards the deceased with a threatening gesture, saying that he would cut him to bits, and did actually cut him, his entire action can only lead to one inference, namely, that he did what he intended to do and that he knew all the time that a blow inflicted with a kathi (knife) would effectuate his intention.85. In the prosecution of an 11-year-old child for throwing a brick at a police vehicle and then running away, the Court said that the justices were not entitled to conclude from his appearance that he was normal in respect of incurring criminal responsibility. The test is whether the child knew that what he was doing was seriously wrong and went beyond childish mischief. Running away was not by itself sufficient to rebut the presumption of doli incapax. A naughty child would run away from a parent or teacher even if what he had done was not criminal.86."

The IPC, 1860 provides no protection from culpable liability on ground of tender age to one who is aged 12 years or more. In a child's life the period between seven and 12 years of age is rather the twilight period of transition to a minimal workable level of understanding of things in the firmament of worldly affairs. And that is why both the IPC, 1860 and the Oaths Act have made special provisions for children below 12 years in respect of matters dependent on a minimal power of understanding.88.\nA claim of juvenility may be raised before any Court and it shall be recognised at any stage, even after final disposal of the case.89.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

For committing a crime, the intention and act both are taken to be the constituents of the crime; actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea. Every normal and sane human being is expected to possess some degree of reason to be responsible for his/her conduct and acts unless contrary is proved. But a person of unsound mind or a person suffering from mental disorder cannot be said to possess this basic norm of human behaviour.90."

      "title": "McNaughten Rule and the origin of Section 84 of IPC, 1860.—",
      "content": "Section 84 clearly gives statutory recognition to the defence of insanity as developed by the Common Law of England in a decision of the House of Lords rendered in the case of R v Daniel McNaughten.91. In that case, the House of Lords formulated the famous Mc Naughten Rules on the basis of the five questions, which had been referred to them with regard to the defence of insanity. The reference came to be made in a case where Mc Naughten was charged with the murder by shooting of Edward Drummond, who was the Pvt Secretary of the then Prime Minister of England Sir Robert Peel. The accused Mc Naughten produced medical evidence to prove that, he was not, at the time of committing the act, in a sound state of mind. He claimed that he was suffering from an insane delusion that the Prime Minister was the only reason for all his problems. He had also claimed that as a result of the insane delusion, he mistook Drummond for the Prime Minister and committed his murder by shooting him. The plea of insanity was accepted and Mc Naughten was found not guilty, on the ground of insanity. The aforesaid verdict became the subject of debate in the House of Lords. Therefore, it was determined to take the opinion of all the judges on the law governing such cases. Five questions were subsequently put to the Law Lords. A comparison of answers to question no. 2 and 3 and the provision contained in section 84 of the IPC, 1860 would clearly indicate that the section is modelled on that answers.92.\nThe essential elements of section 84 are as follows:\n\n(i) The accused must, at the time of commission of the act be of unsound mind;\n(ii) The unsoundness must be such as to make the accused at the time when he is doing the act charged as offence, incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.93. Where it is proved that the accused has committed multiple murders while suffering from mental derangement of some sort and it is found that there is (i) absence of any motive,\n(ii) absence of secrecy, (iii) want of pre-arrangement, and (iv) want of accomplices, it would be reasonable to hold that the circumstances are sufficient to support the inference that the accused suffered from unsoundness of mind.94.\n\nThough the onus of proving unsoundness of mind is on the accused,95. yet it has been held that where during the investigation previous history of insanity is revealed, it is the duty of an honest investigator to subject the accused to a medical examination and place that evidence before the Court and if this is not done, it creates a serious infirmity in the prosecution case and the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused.96. Prosecution is duty bound to subject the accused to a medical examination immediately.97. This onus may, however, be discharged by producing evidence as to the conduct of the accused shortly prior to the offence and his conduct at the time or\n\nimmediately afterwards, also by evidence of his mental condition, his family history and so forth.98. Every person is presumed to know the natural consequences of his act. Similarly every person is also presumed to know the law. The prosecution has not to establish these facts.99.\nThere are four kinds of persons who may be said to be non compos mentis (not of sound mind): (1) an idiot; (2) one made non compos by illness; (3) a lunatic or a madman; and (4) one who is drunk.\nAn idiot is one who is of non-sane memory from his birth, by a perpetual infirmity, without lucid intervals; and those are said to be idiots who cannot count twenty, or tell the days of the week, or who do not know their fathers or mothers, or the like. A person made non compos men-us by illness is excused in criminal cases from such acts as are-committed while under the influence of his disorder. A lunatic is one who is afflicted by mental disorder only at certain periods and vicissitudes, having intervals of reason. Madness is permanent. Lunacy and madness are spoken of as acquired insanity, and idiocy as natural insanity.100."

      "title": "Legal insanity vis-a-vis Medical insanity.—",
      "content": "A distinction is to be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A Court is always concerned with legal insanity, and not with medical insanity. What sections 84, IPC, 1860 provides is defence of legal insanity as distinguished from medical insanity. A person is legally insane when he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that what he was doing was wrong or contrary to law.101. Incapacity of the person on account of insanity must be of the nature which attracts the operation of section 84 IPC, 1860.102. An accused who seeks exoneration from liability of an act under section 84 of the IPC, 1860 is to prove legal insanity and not medical insanity. Expression \"unsoundness of mind\" has not been defined in the IPC, 1860 and it has mainly been treated as equivalent to insanity. But the term insanity carries different meaning in different contexts and describes varying degrees of mental disorder. Every person who is suffering from mental disease is not ipso facto exempted from criminal liability. The mere fact that the accused is conceited, odd, irascible and his brain is not quite all right, or that the physical and mental ailments from which he suffered had rendered his intellect weak and affected his emotions or indulges in certain unusual acts, or had fits of insanity at short intervals or that he was subject to epileptic fits and there was abnormal behaviour or the behaviour is queer are not sufficient to attract the application of section 84 of the IPC, 1860.103. The medical profession would undoubtedly treat the accused as a mentally sick person. However, for the purposes of claiming the benefit of the defence of insanity in law, the appellant would have to prove that his cognitive faculties were so impaired, at the time when the crime was committed, as not to know the nature of the act.104. Only legal insanity is contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.105."

      "content": "Law Commission of India re-visited section 84 of the IPC, 1860 in view of the criticism to the M'Naughten Rules in various countries including Britain but came to the conclusion that law of insanity under section 84 of the IPC, 1860 needs no changes in Indian circumstances.106.\n\nSection 84 lays down the legal test of responsibility in cases of alleged unsoundness of mind. There is no definition of \"unsoundness of mind\" in the Penal Code. The Courts have, however, mainly treated this expression as equivalent to insanity. But the term \"insanity\" itself has no precise definition. It is a term used to describe varying degrees of mental disorder. So, every person, who is mentally diseased, is not ipso facto exempted from criminal responsibility. A distinction is to be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. A Court is concerned with legal insanity, and not with medical insanity.107. In this case, the accused was under medical treatment prior to the occurrence. Evidence indicating that he remained mentally fit for about four years after treatment. During the trial also he was sent for treatment and his conduct was normal thereafter. On such facts, it was held, that the accused was not entitled to protection under section 84. The Court also added that where previous history of insanity of the accused comes to light during investigation, the accused must be medically examined and report placed before the Court. Any lapse in this respect would create infirmity in the prosecution case and the accused may become entitled to benefit of doubt.\n1. 'At the time of doing it'.—It must clearly be proved that at the time of the committing of the act, the party accused was labouring under such a defect of reason, from disease of the mind, as not to know the nature and quality of the act he was doing, or, if he did know it, that he did not know he was doing what was wrong.108. If he did know it, he is responsible.109.\nIn Sheralli Wali Mohammed v State of Maharashtra,110. it was held that:\n\n... it must be proved clearly that, at the time of the commission of the acts, the appellant, by reason of unsoundness of mind, was incapable of either knowing the nature of the act or that the acts were either morally wrong or contrary to law. The question to be asked is, is there evidence to show that, at the time of the commission of the offence, he was labouring under any such incapacity? On this question, the state of his mind before and after the commission of the offence is relevant.\n\nThe crucial point of time for deciding whether the benefit of this section should be given or not is the material time when the offence takes place. If at that moment a man is found to be labouring under such a defect of reason as not to know the nature of the act he was doing or that, even if he knew it, he did not know it was either wrong or contrary to law then this section must be applied. In coming to that conclusion, the relevant circumstances, like the behaviour of the accused before the commission of the offence and his behaviour after the commission of the offence, should be taken into consideration.111. The accused pushed a child of four years into fire resulting in his death but there was nothing to show that there was any deliberateness or preparation to commit the crime. His act was accompanied by manifestations of unnatural brutality and was committed openly. He neither concealed nor ran away nor tried to avoid detection which showed that he was not conscious of his guilt. It was held that the accused was entitled to benefit of section 84 and his conviction under section 302 was set aside.112. The accused, a young boy brought up by his grandfather, went abroad for further studies. When his parents visited abroad they did not care to see him. His grandfather's death was communicated to him much later. On return to India, he committed offences of brutal nature at random. During the pendency of the session's case, he again continued and completed his engineering course and started a printing press and later he managed a garage and allied industries employing nearly 30 persons. His behaviour before and after the offences was that of a normal man. It was held that he was insane at the time of the offence and was given benefit of section\n84.113. Where the accused was examined by two doctors who certified him to be schizophrenic and his abnormal behaviour was also apparent from the evidence on the record, the Supreme Court held that the acquittal of the accused by the High Court was proper.114.\n\nIn other words, to get the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860, it must be shown that at the time of the commission of the act the accused by reason of unsoundness of mind was incapable of either knowing the nature of the act or that the act was either morally wrong or contrary to law and for determining this his state of mind before and after the commission of the offence is most relevant. It would be dangerous to admit the defence of insanity upon arguments derived merely from the character of the crime.115. Thus, the fact that the accused committed the murder over a trifling matter and made a clean breast of his crime would not go to show that he was insane.116."

    "section84.4": {
      "title": "Lucid intervals.—",
      "content": "A lucid interval of an insane person is not merely a cessation of the violent symptoms of the disorder, but a restoration of the faculties of the mind sufficiently to enable the person soundly to judge the act; but the expression does not necessarily mean complete or perfect restoration of the mental faculties to their original condition. So, if there is such a restoration, the person concerned can do the act with such reason, memory and judgment as to make it a legal act; merely a cessation of the violent symptoms of the disorder is not sufficient.117.\n2. 'Unsoundness of mind.'—Whether the want of capacity is temporary or permanent, natural or supervening, whether it arises from disease, or exists from the time of birth, it is included in this expression. It is only 'unsoundness of mind' which naturally impairs the cognitive faculties of the mind that can form a ground of exemption from criminal responsibility.118. The nature and extent of the unsoundness of mind required being such as would make the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.119. Thus, as Stephen says that if a person cuts off the head of a sleeping man because 'it would be great fun to see him looking for it when he woke up', it would obviously be a case where the perpetrator of the act would be incapable of knowing the physical effects of his act.120. The accused had killed his wife and his minor children and assaulted his neighbour and the police officer. The evidence showed that he had a history of insanity with at random assault on strangers but his relations with his wife were cordial. It was held that the accused was a man of unsound mind and his conviction under sections 302, 332 and 323 was set aside.121. The accused caught hold of the legs of a girl of two years of age on the road and struck her on the ground. She sustained head injury and died in the hospital. On the basis of the ocular evidence about the conduct of the accused at the time of the offence and the opinion of the doctor about his state of mind, the accused was acquitted on the ground of insanity.122. The accused, a labourer, killed his brother's wife and attempted to kill his mother in a quarrel over money deposited with his mother. Accused assaulted with axe on the vital parts of the victim's body, absconded for three months and immediately after the incident worked as a labourer in another village for 15 days. It was held that the conduct of the accused immediately before, at the time of and after the incident, was wholly inconsistent with the plea of insanity raised by him. The history of earlier mental derangement was not by itself sufficient to bring the case within section 84.123. Where on the day of the crime the accused was seen dancing with a dog on his head and with a broken bottle, but the medical evidence showed that he was a normal man, it was held that defence of insanity was an afterthought.124. The mere fact that the accused attempted to escape from the scene of occurrence after killing his wife, belied his plea of insanity.125. Where a father and his relatives sacrificed a four-year-old son to propitiate the deity, the Supreme Court held that this does not by itself constitute insanity. Such primitive and inhuman actions must be punished severely so as to deter others from resorting to such barbaric practices.126."

    "section84.5": {
      "title": "Partial delusion.—",
      "content": "Mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion affords no protection under section 84 IPC, 1860.127. Whether a person who, under an insane delusion as to the existing facts, commits an offence in consequence thereof, is to be, therefore, excused depends upon the nature of the delusion. If he labours under a partial delusion only, and is not in other respects insane, he must be considered in the same situation as to responsibility as if the facts, with respect to which the delusion exists, were real.128. If a person afflicted with insane delusion, in respect of one or more particular subjects or persons, commits a crime, knowing that he was acting contrary to law, but did the act complained of with a view, under the influence of insane delusion, of redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury, or of producing some public benefit, he is nevertheless punishable according to the nature of the crime committed.129. Where the accused after killing his daughter tried to commit suicide and there was no evidence of psychiatric treatment but only major depression, he was held liable to be convicted.130.\n\n3. 'Nature of the act, or...what is either wrong or contrary to law.'—If the accused were conscious that an act was done which he ought not to do and if the act was at the same time contrary to the law of the land, he is punishable. His liability will not be diminished if he did the act complained of with a view under the influence of insane delusion of redressing or revenging some supposed grievance or injury or of producing some public benefit, if he knew that he was acting contrary to law.131. Where the accused, a young man, took a girl of four years on a bicycle to a lonely place near a canal, sexually assaulted her and threw her into the canal, it was held that it was a carefully thought out action and not an act of an insane person.132.\nMere absence of motive for a crime, howsoever atrocious it may be, cannot, in the absence of plea and proof of legal insanity, bring the case within this section.133. The mere fact that an act of murder is committed by the accused on a sudden impulse and there is no discoverable motive for the act will not generally afford the Court sufficient basis for accepting the plea of insanity.134. Thus, in SW Mohammed's case the Supreme Court held that the mere fact that no motive has been proved why the accused murdered his wife and child or the fact that he made no attempt to run away when the door was broken open would not indicate that he was insane or that he did not have the necessary mens rea for the offence.135. In a Madras case, however, the Madras High Court has held that where the accused was insane for some months prior to occurrence and on cordial terms with his wife but suddenly killed the wife in the open courtyard without any ostensible motive and did not even attempt to run away or secret his crime, he had to be given the benefit of section 84, IPC, 1860.136. This case can, of course, be distinguished from the above mentioned Supreme Court case on the ground that in the instant case the accused had previous history of insanity which was not fully cured. Prior or subsequent treatment for schizophrenia coupled with the evidence of the doctor that the accused was schizophrenic would entitle the accused to the benefit of section 84 in a charge of murder.137. But where the doctor in his evidence merely said unsoundness of mind may have existed from before and that evidence was contradicted by evidence of close relations about sanity of the accused at the time of the occurrence, it was held that the accused could not get the benefit of section 84, IPC, 1860.138. There is a difference between medical insanity and legal insanity. By medical insanity is meant the prisoner's consciousness of the bearing of his act on those affected by it and by legal insanity is meant the prisoner's consciousness in relation to himself.139. There can be no legal insanity unless the cognitive faculties of the accused are as a result of unsoundness of mind completely impaired. In order to constitute legal insanity unsoundness of mind must be such as to make the offender incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law.140. Thus, mere abnormality of mind or partial delusion,\n\nirresistible impulse or compulsive behaviour of a psychopath affords no protection under section 84 of the IPC, 1860 as the law contained in that section is still squarely based on the outdated M'Naughten Rules of 19th Century England. Thus, in Siddheswari's case141. where the accused killed her ailing child of three and there was also some evidence elicited in cross-examination to show that the accused had suffered from some mental derangement two years prior to the incident, it was held that the mere fact the murder was committed on a sudden impulse or as a \"mercy killing\" was no ground to give her the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860, even though both euthanasia (mercy killing) and irresistible impulse would entitle the accused in England to get the benefit of diminished responsibility and her crime would be treated as manslaughter (i.e. culpable homicide not amounting to murder). In a latter case too the Gauhati High Court felt that where the accused has made out a prima facie case of irresistible impulse the plea has to be taken into consideration in deciding the question of giving benefit of section 84, IPC, 1860, to the accused.142.\nThe position, however, has undergone a sea change in England where the right or wrong test of the M'Naughten Rules no longer dominate this branch of criminal law to the exclusion of mental abnormality falling short of complete insanity as a limited defence establishing a claim to diminished responsibility. Thus, under section 2 of the Homicide Act, 1957 if two Psychiatrists certify that the homicidal act of the accused was influenced by abnormal condition of his mind though not amounting to legal insanity within the meaning of M'Naughten Rules, still he cannot be convicted of murder but his offence will be regarded only as a manslaughter which is equivalent to culpable homicide not amounting to murder under the IPC, 1860. It is hoped that the Indian law too would be changed on this score with due regard to the modern developments in the field of psychology of criminal behaviour."

He was found of unsound mind in his medical examination. Case of accused comes within the four corners of section 84 IPC, 1860.143. Where an accused, who was suffering from fever which caused him while suffering from its paroxysms to be bewildered and unconscious, killed his children at being annoyed at their crying, but he was not delirious then, and there was no evidence to show that he was not conscious of the nature of his act, it was held that he was not entitled to protection under this section.144. But where the accused labouring under a delusion believed his two-month- old infant child to be a devil and danger to himself, his family and to the whole world and, therefore, killed the child with unusual ferocity almost reducing it to a pulp and thereafter without making any attempt to escape told the police party that he had removed a devil from the world, it was held that the accused did not know that what he had done was wrong and as such was entitled to get protection of section 84, IPC, 1860, even when he did not plead insanity in his defence as the prosecution itself disclosed that he was insane.145.

He was not in a normal state of mind at the time of alleged crime. Appellant is entitled to the benefits under section 84 of IPC, 1860.146. The accused killed three persons and caused injuries to others and there was no previous enmity or motive established. The\n\nwitnesses stated that he ran from one place to other and on his way he assaulted five persons indiscriminately without any rhyme or reason. The evidence shows that appellant had developed insanity since long and entitled to the benefit of this section.147. Accused chopped off his wife's head, with a chopper. After the occurrence, in a very unusual and abnormal manner, holding the head and the chopper in each of his hands, he walked down the road and ultimately reached the police station.

In paranoid schizophrenia, the person affected lives in a state of constant fear being haunted by the belief that he is being poisoned, some noxious gases are blown into his room and that all are plotting against him to ruin him. The patient gets very irritated and excited owing to equally painful and disagreeable hallucinations and delusions.159. The accused was convicted for having murdered his wife in a brutal manner. He raised the plea of insanity. It came out from evidence that he was suffering from leprosy and insanity from sometime past. The medical opinion was that he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia which is a form of paranoid psychosis. The plea was allowed. But he being not in a fit state of mind to judge his own welfare or take care of himself without medical aid, the Court directed him to be detained in safe custody under medical supervision and not to be released till medical evidence of social fitness.160. The evidence on record shows that on the day of the incident, when the appellant was examined by doctors, he was found to be suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. He had delusions and persecutory ideas with no insight in his illness. From this, an inference can reasonably be drawn that the accused was under paranoid delusions at the time that he committed the offence.161."

Under the said section, the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.164. But the burden on the accused cannot be equivalent with the burden of proof on the prosecution and cannot be rated higher than the burden on a party to a civil proceeding where a finding can be based upon preponderance of probabilities. There is no conflict between the general burden which is always on the prosecution and which never shifts and the special burden which rests on the accused to make out the defence of insanity.165. Sometimes the facts may in themselves be sufficient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused. This possibility was recognised by the Supreme Court in Ratan Lal v State of MP.166. The accused-appellant was kept in police custody for ten days and only then it was felt that he needed medical examination. There was no evidence on record to show what his condition was during those ten days and why he was not examined earlier. This conduct on the part of the police, neither to arrange his examination nor permit him to do so, brought about such a gap of time between the incident and examination that his condition at the time of the incident was no longer capable of being precisely determined. As against this police inaction, the defence pointed towards the conduct of the accused before the incident and some statements of witnesses which supported the instable condition of the accused. This was held to be sufficient to discharge the burden which lies on the accused and his acquittal was upheld by the Supreme Court. Going by this case in Tukappa Tamanna Lingardi v State of Maharashtra,167. the Bombay High Court found evidence of insanity from a narration of the facts themselves. Mere oral statements of witnesses cannot give rise to an inference that the appellant was of unsound mind at the time of commission of offence. Plea of the accused does not come within exception contemplated under section 84 of IPC, 1860.168. IPC, 1860\n\nWhere there was no satisfactory evidence of the previous history of the accused or his subsequent conduct and the only fact on record was that ghastly murders were committed without motive, it was held that the burden of proof as to plea of insanity was not discharged. However, because of the absence of motive, premeditation and any weapon, killings being done with stone pieces, death sentence was converted into life imprisonment.169. Where, on the other hand, a father killed his son and then danced\n\naround, moving towards his house threatening others, facts spoke for themselves so as to discharge the burden of proof as to insanity, the accused was acquitted and ordered to be detained in a mental home.170.\nMere eccentric behaviour, like drowning one's own two and a half-year-old child to death, does not discharge this burden which is essentially on the accused and requires him to show all the ingredients of the defence to the extent at least of making them probable at the time of the commission of the act. Previous history and subsequent conduct are only relevant facts in the determination of the condition at the material time.171.\nThe mere absence of motive is not sufficient to bring the case within the scope of section 84.172."

      "title": "Sentencing.—Battered woman syndrome.—",
      "content": "The accused woman pleaded guilty to manslaughter on an indictment for murder. She was a young woman aged 20. She began a sexual relationship with the deceased when she was 14 and began to live with him when she was 16. She had a miscarriage and on two occasions took overdoses. The deceased became violent towards her two or three times each week. She sought psychiatric help and on two occasions came to the attention of the police. In 1998 she decided to end the relationship and there was an argument which developed into a fight. She picked up a knife and waved it at the deceased, telling him to leave. There was a further struggle during the course of which the deceased received a fatal knife wound to his back. She immediately shouted for help and was found in an extremely distressed condition. When she was examined, she was found to be extensively bruised. A psychiatrist who examined her found that she exhibited a number of features of the \"battered woman's syndrome\", including chronic depressive illness, a feeling of hopelessness and despair, and inability to act effectively or to see an escape from her situation, and feelings of self-blame, shame and a poor sense of self-worth. A second psychiatrist found a degree of clinical depression which amounted to abnormality of mind. She was sentenced to four years' detention in a young offender institution. Her appeal against the sentence was allowed. In the light of the evidence, the Court reached the conclusion that there were in the present case those exceptional circumstances which would allow the Court to take the unusual course of passing a sentence other than custody. The accused woman had been subject from a young age to persistent and prolonged violence from a man older than herself who was domineering and demanding. Since her arrest she had made remarkable progress, and a custodial sentence would be likely to damage and possibly bring to an end that rehabilitation. She had served the equivalent of a sentence of 12 months and it was appropriate to give her the opportunity to continue her progress. The Court accordingly quashed the sentence of four years' detention in a young offender institution and substituted a probation order.174."

All these aspects also show that at the relevant time, he was not insane as claimed by him.175. Accused committed murder of two persons andcaused injuries to another. Testimony of witnesses was found cogent and reliable and there was no material on the basis of which it could be inferred that at the time of commission of offence the accused was of unsound mind to such an extent that by reason of such unsoundness, he was incapable of knowing the nature of the act or knowing that he was doing what was either wrong or contrary to law, plea of insanity rejected.176. Mere taking treatment earlier in Mental Hospital itself is not sufficient proof of total insanity of person.177.\n\nThe accused killed his wife and daughter with an axe. He attended Kirtan (rendering of religious hymns) a night before. He carried the corpses in a hand-cart and made his statement before the police. His confessional statement was recorded by a competent judicial magistrate. He found no noticeable abnormality of mind or mental disorderliness. Even on his examination under section 313, Cr PC, 1973, he showed a soundness of mind. It was held that he was not entitled to the benefit of section 84.178."

      "content": "The duty cast upon the investigating officer to investigate into the mental condition of the accused is very important. The Supreme Court held that, where during the investigation previous history of insanity is revealed, it is the duty of an honest investigator to subject the accused to a medical examination and place that evidence before the Court and if this is not done, it creates a serious infirmity in the prosecution case and the benefit of doubt has to be given to the accused.180. The Division Bench of High Court of Kerala observed that even if all the acts constituting an offence as per definition in IPC, 1860 are committed by a person, if an investigating officer finds on investigation that by reason of unsoundness of mind, accused was incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he was doing what is either wrong or contrary to law, as stated in Section 84 IPC, 1860, he shall not file a charge sheet against such person.181. The Court also held that the investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\", acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860.182. But the Single Bench of the High Court of Kerala, later, held that the ingredients of section 84 can only be taken as a defence during trial and it is not possible to throw out the Final Report in a case on the ground that the concerned accused was suffering from legal insanity.183."

Section 328-339.\n\nTHE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n\nCHAPTER IV GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\nTHIS chapter has been framed in order to obviate the necessity of repeating in every penal clause a considerable number of limitations.\nThe word 'offence' in this chapter denotes a thing punishable under the Code or under any special or local law when it satisfied the conditions laid down in section 40 of the Code.\nThe \"general exceptions\" contained in sections 76–106 make an offence a non-offence. The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

A person cannot become himself drunk with liquor and commit an offence and then come and say that he had consumed the liquor and, therefore, the benefit of section 85 should be given to him.187. The law pronounces that the obscuration and divestment of that judgment and human feeling which in a sober state would have prevented the accused from offending, shall not, when produced by his voluntary act, screen him from punishment, although he be no longer capable of self-restraint.188. It is also no excuse to say that because of it he failed to resist the impulse to act in a certain way189. or that because of it he acted like an automaton.190."

      "content": "Nevertheless voluntary drunkenness is a factor which has to be taken into consideration at least in two types of cases, viz.,\n(i) where a specific intent is an essential element of an offence charged and the evidence shows that the state of intoxication of the accused is such that he is incapable of forming the specific intent essential to constitute the crime.191. In the Indian context, for example, it would be intent to kill as in clauses 1, 2, and 3 of section 300, IPC, 1860. In such cases, however, even if the accused fails to actually form the specific intent, section 86, IPC, 1860, would impute the necessary guilty knowledge to him and he would, therefore, be liable for culpable homicide not amounting to murder though not of murder.192. Thus, voluntary intoxication amounting to prove incapacity to form the required specific intent would be a limited excuse to reduce an offence of murder (section 302) to one of culpable homicide not amounting murder (section 304, IPC, 1860). This is, however, a question of fact in each case.\nIn a case of wife-burning, her dying declaration disclosed that her husband consumed liquor, scolded her and then set her afire after pouring kerosene on her. She fought the fire and tried to run away but the accused again caught hold of her and again poured oil and inflamed her. It was held that these circumstances showed that the mental faculties of the accused were not impaired to such an extent that he was prevented from forming the requisite intention to cause death. He was convicted under section 302 and not section 304, Part II.193.\n(ii) where habitual drunkenness has resulted in such a diseased condition of the mind that the accused is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. In such a case M'Naughten Rules (section 84, IPC,\n\n1860) would come into play and he would be absolved from liability.194. The most common example of such an alcoholic disease is \"Delirium Tremens\" which is produced by prolonged and habitual excessive drinking and results in loss of the faculty of reasoning or serious defect of reasoning. In other words, \"insanity, whether produced by drunkenness or otherwise, is a defence to the crime charged.\"195.\nUnder this section if a man is made drunk through stratagem or the fraud of others, or through ignorance, or through any other means causing intoxication without the man's knowledge or against his will, he is excused.196."

The sole defence was a plea of drunkenness. It was held that drunkenness was no defence unless it could be established that the accused at the time of committing rape was so drunk that he was incapable of forming the intent to commit it (which was not alleged), inasmuch as the death resulted from a succession of acts, the rape and the act of violence causing suffocation, which could not be regarded independently of each other; and that the accused was guilty of murder.197.\nDrink is an aggravating feature in the award of sentence. In reference to one of the accused persons there was no evidence to establish that the effect of intoxication was such as to cause him to lack the specific intent for murder, particularly in view of the fact that, on his own admission, he was following instructions given by the other accused and he was able to give the police a lucid account of his actions. The degree of intoxication fell far below that which would preclude the formation of specific intent required for murder.198.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

      "title": "Offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge committed by one who is intoxicated.",
      "content": "In cases where an act done is not an offence unless done with a particular knowledge or intent, a person who does the act in a state of intoxication shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been\n\nintoxicated, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nOffence requiring particular intent or knowledge.—By reading the above section, it is clear that in the first part of the section the words 'intention or knowledge' are mentioned, but in the latter part of the section the word 'knowledge' is only mentioned and the word 'intention' is omitted. In case of voluntary drunkenness, knowledge is to be presumed in the same manner as if there was no drunkenness. If really the Parliament wanted the word 'intention' also to be presumed even in the case of an act done in a drunken state of mind, the said word could have been mentioned in the Second part also, but the same is omitted. Therefore, whether the accused was having intention or not while committing an act cannot be presumed as in case of knowledge.199. As certain guilty knowledge or intention forms part of the definition of many offences, this section is provided to meet those cases. It says that a person voluntarily intoxicated will be deemed to have the same knowledge as he would have had if he had not been intoxicated. There may be cases in which a particular knowledge is an ingredient, and there may be other cases in which a particular intent is an ingredient, the two not being necessarily always identical. The section does not say that the accused shall be liable to be dealt with as if he had the same intention as might have been presumed if he had not been intoxicated. Therefore, although there is a presumption so far as knowledge is concerned, there is no such presumption with regard to intention.200. Thus, this section attributes to a drunken man the knowledge of a sober man when judging of his action but does not give him the same intention. This knowledge is the result of a legal fiction and constructive intention cannot invariably be raised.201. Drunkenness makes no difference to the knowledge with which a man is credited and if a man knew what the natural consequences of his acts were, he must be presumed to have intended to cause them.202. But this presumption may be rebutted by his showing that at the time he did the act, his mind was so affected by the drink he had taken that he was incapable of forming the intention requisite for making his act the offence charged against him.203.\n\nSo far as knowledge is concerned the Court must attribute to the intoxicated man the same knowledge as if he was quite sober but so far as intent or intention is concerned, the Court must gather it from the attending general circumstances of the case paying due regard to the degree of intoxication. If the man was beside his mind altogether for the time being, it would not be possible to fix him with the requisite intention. In other words, where a man goes so deep into drinking that he becomes really incapable of forming the requisite specific intent or knowledge for the offence, then in such a case too section 86 of the Code would impute the requisite knowledge to the accused though not the requisite intention. Thus, where the accused in a state of extreme intoxication caused a fatal injury in the abdomen of his friend but by virtue of his highly intoxicated state of mind was incapable of knowing then as to what he was doing far less forming the requisite intent to kill as envisaged in section 300, IPC, 1860, he could not be convicted under section 302 as he did not have the requisite intent to kill but he could still be convicted under section 304 Part II, IPC, 1860, by virtue of imputed knowledge under section 86, IPC, 1860.204. In this connection see also the discussion under sub-head \"voluntary drunkenness: when an excuse\" under section 85, ante. But if he had not gone so deep in drinking and from the facts it could be found that he knew what he was about the Court will apply the rule that a man is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his act or acts.205."

No evidence as regards the degree of intoxication or any evidence of any attending general circumstances to arrive at a conclusion that accused was beside his mind altogether temporarily at time incident.207. On the basis of evidence in this case, it cannot be said that the accused was so much intoxicated at the time of the incident that he was beside his mind altogether for the time being. He did set his wife on fire, but as soon as her sari started burning he realised the folly of his act and started extinguishing the fire.

These provisions show that if the intoxication is induced voluntarily, the act done is an offence even if the person is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that what he is doing is either wrong or contrary to law. This section obviously covers all offences. That is why; it appears that it became necessary to enact section 86 to take care of offences requiring a particular intent or knowledge on the part of the intoxicated offender. The section takes care of such offences and states that if intoxication is involuntary, neither knowledge nor intention in committing the offence will be presumed. If however, it is voluntary only knowledge of the offence on the part of the offender will be presumed but not intention in committing it. What section 86 means and no more as compared to section 85. The degree of intoxication demanded by both sections, however, remains the same. In fact, it is instructive to note that section 84 which exempts persons of unsoundness of mind also expects the degree of unsoundness to the same extent, viz., incapability of knowing the nature of the act or of the knowledge that what is being done either wrong or contrary to law. Hence, the conclusion is inescapable that to avail of the exception under section 86, the degree of intoxication of the offender must be such that he is incapable of knowing the nature of the act or that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law. Intoxication short of this degree will not entitle the offender to the benefit of the exception.209.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

This agreement implies the consent of each to suffer any harm which, in the course of such fencing, may be caused without foul play; and if A, while playing fairly, hurts Z, A commits no offence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nConsent.—This section protects a person who causes injury to another person above 18 years of age who has given his consent by doing an act not intended and not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt. It appears to proceed upon the maxim volenti non fit injuria. He who consents suffers no injury. This rule is founded upon two very simple propositions: (1) that every person is the best judge of his own interest and\n(2) that no man will consent to what he thinks hurtful to himself. Every man is free to inflict any suffering or damage he chooses on his own person and property; and if, instead of doing this himself, he consents to its being done by another, the doer commits no offence. A man may give away his property, and so another who takes it by his permission does not commit theft. He may inflict self-torture or he may consent to suffer torture at the hands of another.\nThe section does not permit a man to give his consent to anything intended, or known to be likely to cause his own death or grievous hurt."

A has committed no offence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThe preceding section allows any harm to be inflicted short of death or grievous hurt. This section sanctions the infliction of any harm if it is for the benefit of the person to whom it is caused. No consent can justify an intentional causing of death. But a person for whose benefit a thing is done may consent that another shall do that thing, even if death may probably ensue. If a person gives his free and intelligent consent to take the risk of an operation which, in a large proportion of cases, has proved fatal, the surgeon who operates cannot be punished even if death ensues.213. Again; if a person attacked by a wild beast should call out to his friends to fire, though with imminent hazard to himself, and they were to obey the call, we do not conceive that it would be expedient to punish them, though they might by firing cause his death, and though when they fired they knew themselves to be likely to cause his death.214.\n\nThis section differs from the last section in two particulars—(1) under it any harm except death may be inflicted; (2) the age of the person consenting is not mentioned (but see section 90 under which the age of the consenting party must at least be 12 years).\nPersons not qualified as medical practitioners cannot claim the benefit of this section as they can hardly be deemed to act in 'good faith' as that expression is defined in section 52.215."

Where a patient's death results merely from error of judgment or an accident, no criminal liability should be attached to it. Mere inadvertence or some degree of want of adequate care and caution might create civil liability but would not suffice to hold him criminally liable.216. Even if the surgery was done without the consent of the patient or his/her guardian, if it is for the benefit of the patient he is not liable.

The consent of the guardian of a sufferer, who is an infant or who is of unsound mind, shall have the same effect which the consent of the sufferer himself would have, if the sufferer were of ripe age and sound mind."

It is an archaic notion that to maintain discipline, child can be punished physically by the teaching staff because of implied consent by the parents or guardian. Now it is recognized social principle that even parents of the child are made to understand the basic human rights of the child and instead of corporal punishment, correctional methods are recognized in law.218. But the applicability of sections 88 and 89, IPC, 1860 and administering of corporal punishments on students by the teachers for their benefit, came up for consideration in M Natesan v State of Madras.219. It was a case where a boy of 15 years was sent with the progress report to get the signature of his parents in it. But he returned it with a thumb impression of another person, stating that the said thumb impression was that of his mother, which was proved to be wrong. The teacher got agitated and he beat the boy on his right palm with a stick. He did not cry. He, therefore, beat him again, asking him why he did not cry. This resulted in causing three injuries, two superficial and one contusion. The Madras High Court held that:\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

      "content": "A consent is not such a consent as is intended by any section of this Code, if the consent is given by a person under fear of injury, or under a misconception of fact, 1\n\nand if the person doing the act knows, or has reason to believe, that the consent was given in consequence of such fear or misconception; or\n\nConsent of insane person.\n\nif the consent is given by a person who, from unsoundness of mind, or intoxication, is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent; or\n\nConsent of child.\n\nunless the contrary appears from the context, if the consent is given by a person who is under twelve years of age.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section does not define 'consent' but describes what not consent is. This section says that consent is not a true consent if it is given—\n(1) by a person under fear of injury;\tand the person obtaining the consent knows or\nhas reason to believe this.\n(2) by a person under a misconception of fact;\n(3) by a person of unsound mind;\tand who is unable to understand the nature\n(4) by a person who is intoxicated;\tand consequence of that to which he gives his\nconsent.\n(5) by a person under 12 years of age\n\nConsent is an act of reason, accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing as in balance, the good and evil on each side.222. Consent means an active will in the mind of a person to permit the doing of the act complained of, and knowledge of what is to be done, or of the nature of the act that is being done, is essential to consent to an act.223. An act of helplessness on the face of inevitable compulsions is not consent in law.224. It requires voluntary participation by victim not only after exercise of intelligence based on knowledge of significance and moral quality of act, but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent.225. A mere act of helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, non-resistance and passive giving in cannot be deemed to be consent.226. The Supreme Court in a long line of cases has given wider meaning to the word 'consent' in the context of sexual offences as explained in various judicial dictionaries. In Jowitt's Dictionary of English Law (Second Edn), vol (1) 1977 at p 422 the word 'consent' has been explained as an act of reason accompanied with deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good or evil on either side. It is further stated that consent supposes three things–a physical power, a mental power, and a free and serious use of them and if consent be obtained by intimidation, force, meditated imposition, circumvention, surprise, or undue influence, it is to be treated as a delusion, and not as a deliberate and free act of the mind.227. Section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive definition of consent for the purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not intended to be excluded.228. For determining whether consent given by the prosecutrix was voluntary or under a misconception of fact, no straitjacket formula can be laid down.229.\n\nThe factors set out in the first part are from the point of view of the victim. The second part enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It envisages that the accused too has the knowledge or reason to believe that the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of fact. The requirements of both the parts have to be cumulatively satisfied.230. Submission of the body under the fear of terror cannot be construed as a consented sexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the significance and moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful study of all relevant circumstances.231. Consent can be obtained under various methods and always necessarily need not be a one which is given voluntarily. For example, if a victim is intoxicated without her knowledge or consent and if the rape is committed while the victim was intoxicated or drunken, it cannot be said that she had voluntarily given the consent. Therefore, such passive consent cannot be treated as a consent as contemplated by section 90 of IPC, 1860.232. Obtaining consent by exercising deceit cannot be legitimate defence to exculpate an accused.233."

      "title": "Submission to Rape.—",
      "content": "An act of submission does not involve consent- Consent cannot be equated to inability to resist or helplessness.234. Every consent involves a submission, but every submission is not consent and the mere fact that a woman had submitted to the promise of the accused does not necessarily indicate that her consent existed unless the evidence on record establishes that the sexual act, which the prosecutrix had allowed, was accompanied with deliberation after the mind had weighed, as in a balance, the good and the evil on each side with the existing capacity and power to withdraw the assent according to one's will or pleasure.235. Where, the accused had sexual intercourse with the prosecutrix by giving false assurance to her that he would marry her and when she became pregnant, he refused to do so, it was evident that he never intended to marry her and procured her consent only for the reason of having sexual relations with her, therefore, the act of the accused fell squarely under the definition of rape as her consent was obtained under a misconception of fact.236.\n\n1. 'Misconception of fact'.—The expression \"under a misconception of fact\" is broad enough to include all cases where the consent is obtained by misrepresentation; the misrepresentation should be regarded as leading to a misconception of the facts with reference to which the consent is given. In section 3 of the Evidence Act Illustration (d) states that a person has a certain intention is treated as a fact. So, here the fact about which the second and third prosecution witnesses were made to entertain a misconception was the fact that the second accused intended to get the girl married... \"thus... if the consent of the person from whose possession the girl is taken is obtained by fraud, the taking is deemed to be against the will of such a person…\" Although in cases of contracts a consent obtained by coercion or fraud is only voidable by the party affected by it, the effect of section 90 IPC, 1860 is that such consent cannot, under the criminal law, be availed of to justify what would otherwise be an offence.237. Consent may be express or implied, coerced or misguided, obtained willingly or through deceit. Consent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex and in a case like this, the Court must very carefully examine whether the accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala fide motives, and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the ambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a promise, and not fulfilling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there was made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether the  consent  involved  was  given  after  wholly,  understanding  the  nature  and\n\nconsequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not solely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an accused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so. Such cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if the Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala fide, and that he had clandestine motives.238. In order to come within the meaning of misconception of fact, the fact must have an immediate relevance. If a fully grown-up girl consents to the act of sexual intercourse on a promise of marriage and continues to indulge in such activity until she becomes pregnant, it is an act of promiscuity on her part and not an act induced by misconception of fact and it was held that section 90 IPC, 1860 cannot be invoked unless the Court can be assured that from the inception the accused never intended to marry her. Therefore, it depends on case to case that what is the evidence led in the matter. If it is a fully grown-up girl who gave the consent then it is a different case but a girl whose age is very tender and she is giving a consent after persuasion of three months on the promise that the accused will marry her which he never intended to fulfil right from the beginning which is apparent from the conduct of the accused, in our opinion, section 90 can be invoked.239. A promise to marry without anything more will not give rise to \"misconception of fact\" within the meaning of section 90, it needs to be clarified that a representation deliberately made by the accused with a view to elicit the assent of the victim without having the intention or inclination to marry her, will vitiate the consent. If on the facts it is established that at the very inception of the making of promise, the accused did not really entertain the intention of marrying her and the promise to marry held out by him was a mere hoax, the consent ostensibly given by the victim will be of no avail to the accused to exculpate him from the ambit of section 375 clause second.240."

      "content": "The prosecutrix had sexual intercourse with the accused on the representation made by the accused that he would marry her. This was a false promise held out by the accused. Had this promise not been given perhaps, she would not have permitted the accused to have sexual intercourse. It appears that the intention of the accused was, right from the beginning, not honest and he kept on promising that he will marry her, till she became pregnant. This kind of consent obtained by the accused cannot be said to be any consent because she was under a misconception of fact that the accused intends to marry her, therefore, she had submitted to sexual intercourse with him.241. In Uday v State of Karnataka,242. the Court considered the following facts: (i) where a girl was of 19 years of age and had sufficient intelligence to understand the significance and moral quality of the act she was consenting to; (ii) she was conscious of the fact that her marriage was difficult on account of caste considerations; (iii) it was difficult to impute to the appellant, knowledge that the prosecutrix had consented in consequence of a misconception of the fact arising from his promise; and (iv) there was no evidence to prove conclusively that the appellant never intended to marry the prosecutrix. On the basis of the above factors, Court held that it did not feel persuaded to hold that consent was obtained by misconception of facts on the part of the victim.\nIn a case, the prosecutrix had left her home voluntarily, of her own free will to get married to the accused. She was 19 years of age at the relevant time and was, hence, capable of understanding the complications and issues surrounding her marriage to the appellant. According to the version of events provided by her, the prosecutrix had called the accused on a number given to her by him, to ask him why he had not met her at the place that had been pre-decided by them. She also waited for him for a long time,\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5."

      "content": "Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such harm.\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nslight harm or trifles.—The maxim de minimis non curat lex (the law takes no account of trifles) is the foundation of this section. The authors of the Code observe:\nClause 73 [this section] is intended to provide for those cases which, though, from the imperfections of language, fall within the letter of the penal law, are yet not within its spirit, and are all over the world considered by the public, and for the most part dealt with by the tribunals, as innocent. As our definitions are framed, it is theft to dip a pen in another man's ink, mischief to crumble one of his wafers, an assault to cover him with a cloud of dust by riding past him, hurt to incommode him by pressing against him in getting into a carriage. There are innumerable acts without performing which men cannot live together in society, acts which all men constantly do and suffer in turn, and which it is desirable that they should do and suffer in turn, yet which differ only in degree from crimes. That these acts ought not to be treated as crimes is evident, and we think it far better expressly to except them from the penal clauses of the Code than to leave it to the judges to except them in practice.253.\n\nThe expression 'harm' has been used in this section in a wide sense including physical injury and hence, this section applies in cases of actual physical injury also. This section applies not only to acts which are accidental but also to deliberate acts which cause harm or are intended to cause harm or known to be likely to cause harm.254. In a campaign by Sarvodaya workers to educate people about the evil of alcohol, liquor shops were picketed to prevent people from going there even if it was at the cost of slight harm; their prosecution under section 341 for causing wrongful restraint was quashed.255. Where the accused locked the complainant inside the factory by pulling down the shutter, it was held that ingredients of the offence under section 342 (wrongful confinement) were established but as the complainant regained his freedom within a very short time and only a minimal harm was caused, the case was clearly covered by section 95.256."

So also an offence of misbranding260. and the conduct of a lawyer in using filthy language in course of cross-examination261. were treated as trivial.\nWhere the record of the trial Court showed that the injury caused was very simple, being in the nature of a scratch, the Court said that the act was so trivial that no person of a sound common sense would regard it as an offence. The prayer of the complainant for conviction of the accused for causing simple hurt under section 323 was liable to be rejected.262."

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\n\nOf the Right of Private Defence"

      "content": "Nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nIn a civilised society the defence of person and property of every member thereof is the responsibility of the State. Consequently, there is a duty cast on every person faced with apprehension of imminent danger of his person or property to seek the aid of the machinery provided by the State but if immediately such aid is not available, he has the right of private defence. Right to private defence is a very valuable right and it has been recognized in all civilized and democratic societies within certain reasonable limits. Sections 96–106 of IPC, 1860 codify the entire law relating to right of private defence of person and property including the extent of and the limitation to exercise of such right. When enacting sections 96 to 106 of the IPC, 1860, excepting from its penal provisions, certain classes of acts, done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful aggressions, the Legislature clearly intended to arouse and encourage the manly spirit of self-defence amongst the citizens, when faced with grave danger.269."

    "section96.1": {
      "title": "Principle.—",
      "content": "The basic principle underlying the doctrine of the right of private defence is that when an individual or his property is faced with a danger and immediate aid from the State machinery is not readily available, that individual is entitled to protect himself and his property.270. The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. That being so, the necessary corollary is that the violence which the citizen defending himself or his property is entitled to use must not be unduly disproportionate to the injury which is sought to be averted or which is reasonably apprehended and should not exceed its legitimate purpose. The law does not require a law abiding citizen to behave like a coward when confronted with an imminent unlawful aggression. There is nothing more degrading to the human spirit than to run away in face of danger. The right of private defence is thus, designed to serve a social purpose and deserves to be fostered within the prescribed limits. The IPC, 1860 defines homicide in self-defence as a form of substantive right, and therefore, save and except the restrictions imposed on the right of the Code itself, it seems that the special rule of English Law as to the duty of retreating will have no application to this country where there is a real need for defending oneself against deadly assaults. The right to protect one's own person and property against the unlawful aggressions of others is a right inherent in man. The duty of protecting the person and property of others is a duty which man owes to society of which he is a member and the preservation of which is both his interest and duty. It is, indeed, a duty which flows from human sympathy.\nAs Bentham said:\n\nIt is a noble movement of the heart, that indignation which kindles at the sight of the feeble injured by the strong. It is noble movement which makes us forget our danger at the first cry of distress  It concerns the public safety that every honest man should consider himself\nas the natural protector of every other.\n\nBut such protection must not be extended beyond the necessities of the case; otherwise it will encourage a spirit or lawlessness and disorder. The right has, therefore, been restricted to offences against the human body and those relating to aggression on property. Right of private defence of person and property is recognized in all free, civilised, democratic societies within certain reasonable limits. Those limits are dictated by two considerations: (1) that the same right is claimed by all other members of the society and (2) that it is the State which generally undertakes the responsibility for the maintenance of law and order. The citizens, as a general rule, are neither expected to run away for safety when faced with grave and imminent danger to their person or property as a result of unlawful aggression, nor are they expected, by\n\nuse of force, to right the wrong done to them or to punish the wrong doer of commission of offences.271."

      "title": "Scope.—",
      "content": "Section 96 IPC, 1860 provides that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the right of private defence. The section does not define the expression \"right of private defence\". It merely indicates that nothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of such right.272. While providing for exercise of the right, care has been taken in IPC, 1860 not to provide and has not devised a mechanism whereby an attack may be a pretence for killing. A right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive, particularly when the need to defend no longer survived.273. Just because one circumstance exists amongst the various factors, which appears to favour the person claiming right of self-defence, does not mean that he gets the right to cause the death of the other person. Even the right of self-defence has to be exercised directly in proportion to the extent of aggression.274."

    "section96.3": {
      "title": "Test.—",
      "content": "Whether in a particular set of circumstances, a person legitimately acted in the exercise of the right of private defence is a question of fact to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case. No test in the abstract for determining such a question can be laid down. In determining this question of fact, the Court must consider all the surrounding circumstances. It is not necessary for the accused to plead in so many words that he acted in self-defence. If the circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to consider such a plea.275. The means and the force a threatened person adopts at the spur of the moment to ward off the danger and to save himself or his property cannot be weighed in golden scales. It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down abstract parameters which can be applied to determine as to whether the means and force adopted by the threatened person was proper or not. Answer to such a question depends upon host of factors like the prevailing circumstances at the spot; his feelings at the relevant time; the confusion and the excitement depending on the nature of assault on him etc. Nonetheless, the exercise of the right of private defence can never be vindictive or malicious. It would be repugnant to the very concept of private defence.276. A person who is apprehending death or bodily injury cannot weigh in golden scales in the spur of moment and in the heat of circumstances, the number of injuries required to disarm the assailants who were armed with weapons. In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium it is often difficult to expect the parties to preserve composure and use exactly only so much force in retaliation commensurate with the danger apprehended to him where assault is imminent by use of force, it would be lawful to repel the force in self-defence and the right of private defence commences, as soon as the threat becomes so imminent. Such situations have to be pragmatically viewed and not with high powered spectacles or microscopes to detect slight or even marginal overstepping. Due weightage has to be given to, and hyper technical approach has to be avoided in considering what happens on the spur of the moment on the spot and keeping in view normal human reaction and conduct, where self-preservation is the paramount consideration. But, if the fact situation shows that in the guise of self-preservation, what really has been done is to assault the original aggressor, even after the cause of reasonable apprehension has disappeared, the plea of right of private defence can legitimately be negatived. The Court dealing with the plea has to weigh the material to conclude whether the plea is acceptable. It is\n\nessentially, as noted above, a finding of fact.277. Situations have to be judged from the subjective point of view of the accused concerned in the surrounding excitement and confusion of the moment, confronted with a situation of peril and not by any microscopic and pedantic scrutiny. In adjudging the question as to whether more force than was necessary was used in the prevailing circumstances on the spot it would be inappropriate, as held by this Court, to adopt tests by detached objectivity which would be so natural in a Court room, or that which would seem absolutely necessary to a perfectly cool bystander. The person facing a reasonable apprehension of threat to himself cannot be expected to modulate his defence step-by-step with any arithmetical exactitude of only that much which is required in the thinking of a man in ordinary times or under normal circumstances.278.\nMere use of abusive language does not give rise to private defence. Thus, where the deceased about a month before the murder had tried to outrage the modesty of the wife of the accused and thereafter on the day of the incident cut a rustic joke enquiring whether the accused had not kept buffaloes for drinking milk which lead the accused to beat the deceased mercilessly resulting in his death, it was held that giving the most charitable interpretation one could not find a single circumstance which will give the accused the benefit of the right of private defence and the interval between the attempt to outrage the modesty of the accused's wife and the murder being too long he was also not entitled to get the benefit of grave and sudden provocation within the meaning of exception 1 to section 300, IPC, 1860.279. Giving a general view of all the provisions on this right in Munney Khan v State,280. the Supreme Court observed:\nThe right of private defence is codified in sections 96 to 106, IPC, which have all to be read together in order to have a proper grasp of the scope and limitations of this right. By enacting the sections the authors of the Code wanted to except from the operation of its penal clauses acts done in good faith for the purpose of repelling unlawful aggression.281.\nSummary of Principles regarding Private defence\n\n(i) Self-preservation is the basic human instinct and is duly recognized by the criminal jurisprudence of all civilized countries. All free, democratic and civilized countries recognize the right of private defence within certain reasonable limits.\n(ii) The right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger and not of self-creation.\n(iii) A mere reasonable apprehension is enough to put the right of self-defence into operation. In other words, it is not necessary that there should be an actual commission of the offence in order to give rise to the right of private defence. It is enough if the accused apprehended that such an offence is contemplated and it is likely to be committed if the right of private defence is not exercised.\n(iv) The right of private defence commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension arises and it is co-terminus with the duration of such apprehension.\n(v) It is unrealistic to expect a person under assault to modulate his defence step by step with any arithmetical exactitude.\n(vi) In private defence the force used by the accused ought not to be wholly disproportionate or much greater than necessary for protection of the person or property.\n(vii) It is well settled that even if the accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to consider such a plea if the same arises from the material on record.\n(viii) The accused need not prove the existence of the right of private defence\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n(ix) The IPC, 1860 confers the right of private defence only when that unlawful or wrongful act is an offence.\n(x) A person who is in imminent and reasonable danger of losing his life or limb may in exercise of self-defence inflict any harm even extending to death on his assailant either when the assault is attempted or directly threatened.\n[Darshan Singh v State of Punjab.282.]\n\nAll the sections would have to be read together to ascertain whether in the facts and circumstances of the case the accused were entitled to the defence or they exceeded it. Only then one can get a comprehensive view of the scope and limitations of the right.283.\n1. Availability or Non-availability of private defence.—Factors to be kept in view.— In order to find whether right of private defence is available or not, the entire incident must be examined with care and viewed in its proper setting. The injuries received by the accused, the imminence of threat to his safety, the injuries caused by the accused and the circumstances whether the accused had time to have recourse to public authorities are all relevant factors to be considered on a plea of private defence.284. The right of private defence is a defence right. It is neither a right of aggression nor a right of reprisal. There is no right of private defence where there is no apprehension of danger. Right of private defence is available only to one who is suddenly confronted with the necessity of averting an impending danger not of self-creation. The necessity must be a present necessity whether real or only apparent.285. It remains a question of fact whether the right has been legitimately exercised.286. Thus, running to house, fetching a sword and assaulting the deceased are by no means a matter of chance. These acts bear stamp of a design to kill and take the case out of the purview of private defence.287. But where the accused was dispossessed of his land by a party of men and he ran to his residence from where he fetched his gun and came back within 15 minutes to fire at and injure them, he was held to be within his rights, but when he went further still and chased and injured a person who was just standing by there and who died, in reference to him the accused had no right of private defence.288. Along with the above factors one has also to remember the following limitations on the right of private defence of person or property:\n\n(i) that if there is sufficient time for recourse to public authorities, the right are not available;\n(ii) that more harm than that is necessary should not be caused;\n(iii) that there must be a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt or hurt to the person or damage to the property concerned.289. Where on account of some incident, the accused was confronted by three persons; it was held that the superiority in numbers in itself could in all probability have been construed by the accused as an imminent danger to himself thus, giving him the signal to act in exercise of the right of private defence.290.\n\nThe need to act must not have been created by the conduct of the accused in the immediate context of the incident which was likely or intended to give rise to that need.291. The Supreme Court reiterated the various principles governing the law of private defence and observed that it was essentially a defensive right and did not include the right to launch an offensive attack, particularly when the need for defence no longer existed.292. A right of private defence given by the Penal Code is essentially\n\none of defence or self-protection and not a right of reprisal or punishment. It is subject to the restrictions indicated in section 99 which are as important as the right itself.293."

Accused had no right to invoke right of self-defence by chasing second deceased and to cause fatal injuries upon him.294. Where the accused were in fact the aggressors and being members of the aggressors party none of the accused can claim right of self-defence.295. Merely because there was a quarrel and some of the accused person sustained injuries, that does not confer a right of private defence extending to the extent of causing death. It has to be established that the accused person were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and property that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary. Right of private defence has been rightly discarded.296.\n\nThe defence claimed that the place of occurrence was the house of the accused and, therefore, they had acted in self-defence but that was not proved through any leading evidence despite the examination of the accused under section 313 of the Cr PC, 1973, it was held that the right of self-defence was not available to them.297."

Without formally taking a plea of self-defence, the accused has a right to probabilise such defence on the basis of the prosecution evidence and if he succeeds in his effort, the Court can give him such a benefit.300.\n2. Duty to retreat, if any.—It is now well settled that the rule of retreat which Common Law Courts espoused is not relevant under the IPC, 1860. If a man's property is in imminent danger of being impaired or attacked he has the right to resort to such measures as would be reasonably necessary to thwart the attempt to protect his property.301. Under the common law the doctrine of necessity permitted one to defend one's person or property or the person or property of others against an unjustified attack by the use of reasonable force. In determining what was reasonable force, which in the Indian context means minimum force under section 99, IPC, 1860, the common law Courts always insisted if the accused could prevent the commission of crime against him by retreating. On this rule of retreat one would like to ask: if a person is attacked by an armed burglar in his own room, he is expected to run away leaving the burglar to act as he liked.302. In Jaidev's case303. Gajendragadkar, J, as he then was,\n\nspecifically held that in India there is no rule which expects a man first to run away or at least try to do so before he can exercise his right of private defence. Rather he has every right to stand his own ground and defend himself if there is no time to have recourse to official help. Law does not expect a citizen to be a rank coward or leave his own house at the mercy of the burglar.304. In spite of this clear exposition of the law in Jaidev's case Sarkaria, J, held in Yogendra Morarji's case305. that one must first try to avoid the attack by retreating otherwise one would not be entitled to get the benefit of private defence. It appears that Jaidev's case was not canvassed before the learned judges who decided the latter case. It is submitted with utmost respect that the former view as held in Jaidev's case, appears to be more reasonable and has to be preferred.\n\n3. No Private defence in a free fight.—Where both sides can be convicted for their individual acts, normally no right of private defence is available to either party and they will be guilty of their respective acts.306. Where two parties come armed with determination to measure their strength and to settle a dispute by force and in the ensuing fight both sides receive injuries, no question of right of private defence arises. In such a case of free fight both parties are aggressors and none of them can claim right of private defence.307. In a free fight between two groups resulting in the death of one and injuries to several others both grievous and simple, all the accused participated in the fight. The plea of one of the accused that he joined the fight later and acted in defence of other co-accused was held to be not tenable. The Court observed that his case could not be separated by giving him right of private defence under the benefit of doubt.308. In a sudden fight between two groups in heat of passion death of a man was caused and several others on both the sides were injured. The deceased opened the assault first. It was held that in such fights the question that which party opened attack first is immaterial. Plea of right of self-defence was not allowed to the accused.309. Where two groups forming an unlawful assembly over the possession of land in dispute which was in peaceful possession of neither group, indulged in free fight resulting in the death of two persons of a group, it was held that right of private defence was not available to either group.310.\nThe right to voluntary causing of death or any other harm is available against the assailant and not against any other person.311.\n4. Injury to accused.—If makes out private defence.—Number of injuries on the accused by itself may not be sufficient to establish the right of private defence.312. The number of injuries is not always considered to be a safe criterion for determining who the aggressor was. It can also not be laid down as an unqualified proposition of law that whenever injuries are on the body of the accused person, the presumption must necessarily be raised that the accused person had caused injuries in exercise of the right of private defence. The defence has to further establish that the injury so caused on the accused probabilise the version of the right of private defence.313. Non- explanation of injuries on the person of the accused is a factor of great importance and this fact may induce the Court in judging the veracity of prosecution witnesses with considerable care.314. The right of private defence cannot justifiably be raised by showing that one of the accused had suffered some minor injuries and the prosecution had not explained the same.315. In a given case it may strengthen the plea of private defence set up by the accused or may create genuine doubt regarding the prosecution case. At the same time it cannot be laid down as an invariable proposition of law that as soon as it is found that the accused had received injuries in the same transaction in which the complainant party was assaulted, the plea of private defence would stand prima facie established and burden would shift on to the prosecution to prove that those injuries were caused to the accused in self-defence by the complainant party.316. When the accused turned back from the house of the deceased whom they had visited, the deceased followed them along with his brother and mother and tried to attack them\n\nfrom behind. The accused turned back and shot at him causing death. It was held that the conduct of the accused was justifiable. His acquittal was not interfered with.317. Where the deceased along with his father was putting up a fence which was protested by the accused resulting in an altercation, and the accused suddenly dealt a lathi blow on the head of the deceased which proved fatal, it was held that since the accused received injuries as a result of assault by the deceased and his father, the accused had justifiably exercised his right of private defence.318. In a case of murder some of the serious injuries found on the person of the accused were not explained and some of the prosecution witnesses also were injured, it was held that it could be said that the accused party had acted in exercise of right of private defence and confirmation of the acquittal of all the accused but one by the High Court was not proper.319. Where serious injuries inflicted on the person of the accused could not be explained by the prosecution, the accused could be said to be entitled to the right of private defence. Their conviction under section 300 was held to be not proper.320.\n\nIn State of UP v Mukunde,321. the Supreme Court observed that merely on the ground that the prosecution witnesses have not explained the injuries on the accused, their evidence ought not to be rejected if the Court finds it probable that the accused might have acted in exercise of the right of private defence. The Supreme Court also observed in a subsequent case322. that:\nit cannot be held as a matter of law or invariably a rule that whenever an accused sustained an injury in the same occurrence the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury and on the failure of the prosecution to do so, the prosecution case should be disbelieved. Before non- explanation of injuries on the person of the accused by the prosecution witnesses may affect the prosecution case, the court has to be satisfied of the existence of two conditions:\n(1) that the injuries on the person of the accused were of a serious nature and (ii) such injuries must have been received at the time of the occurrence in question. Non-explanation of injuries assumes greater significance when the evidence consists of interested or partisan witnesses or where the defence gives a version which completes in probability with that of the prosecution.323.\n\nThese rulings were followed in Kashi Ram v State of MP324. The accused persons were alleged to have assaulted the prosecution party, but the prosecution witnesses failed to explain serious injuries including injuries on the vital parts of the body sustained by one of the accused in the same incident. The Court said that this could not be a ground for discarding the prosecution story and for acquittal of all accused persons.\nWhere the accused had some trivial injuries on non-vital parts but the victim had suffered as many as 19 injuries including some on vital parts which resulted in his death, it could not be believed that the accused had acted in self-defence especially when he was arrested five or six days after the incident but in the intervening time did not care to get himself medically examined. A plea of private defence cannot be based on surmises and speculation.325.\nThe Supreme Court has also observed that merely because there was a quarrel and the accused persons also sustained injuries, it did not confer a right of private defence to the extent of causing death. Though such right cannot be weighed in golden scales, it has at least to be shown that the accused persons were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and property and that the retaliation to the extent actually done was absolutely necessary.326.\nThe number of injuries is not always a safe criterion for determining as to who was the aggressor. It cannot be stated as a universal rule that whenever injuries are on the body of the accused person, a presumption must necessarily be raised that the accused persons had caused injuries in the exercise of the right of private defence. The defence has further to show that injuries on the accused probabilise the version of the right of private defence.327. In moments of excitement and disturbed mental equilibrium, parties cannot be expected to preserve composure and use exactly only so much in\n\nretaliation as is commensurate with the apprehended danger. Due weightage has to be given to what happened at the spur of the moment at the spot. Things have to be judged pragmatically keeping in view, the normal human reactions and behaviour, self- preservation being the paramount consideration. Microscopic and pedantic scrutiny has to be avoided.328."

      "content": "The Supreme Court observed:\n\nFrom a plain reading of the sections (Ss. 96–106) it is manifest that such a right can be exercised only to repel unlawful aggression and not to retaliate. To put it differently, the right is one of defence and not of requital or reprisal. Such being the nature of the right, the High Court could not have exonerated the accused persons of the charges levelled against them by bestowing on them the right to retaliate and attack the complainant party.329."

      "title": "Where private defence not pleaded.—",
      "content": "If circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised, it is open to the Court to consider such a plea, even if accused had not taken it. A right of private defence need not specifically be taken and in the event the Court on the basis of the materials placed on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion, the Court may act thereupon.330. Where the right of private defence was not pleaded by the accused, but it appeared that the complainant was the aggressor, the Bombay High Court held that the benefit of such defence could still be given to the accused.331. Fact that accused pleaded alibi-itself will not preclude the Court from giving him also the right of private defence if on proper appraisal of evidence and other material on records, Court finds it to be available to him.332. The right of private defence cannot be denied merely because the accused adopted a different line of defence particularly when the evidence adduced by the prosecution would indicate that they were put under a situation where they could reasonably have apprehended grievous hurt even to one of them.333. The Supreme Court endorsed this principle by saying that it is not necessary that the plea of private defence must always be taken by the accused person. Even if the accused does not do so, the Court can consider it if the circumstances show that the right of private defence was legitimately exercised.334.\nThe accused has not to plead self-defence by examining some witnesses or by making any statement. But there has to be some material available on record to indicate that the accused had attacked the deceased in exercise of the right of self-defence.335."

Mehi Lal v State of UP, 2011 Cr LJ 1440 (All).\n\nTHE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n\nCHAPTER IV GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\nTHIS chapter has been framed in order to obviate the necessity of repeating in every penal clause a considerable number of limitations.\nThe word 'offence' in this chapter denotes a thing punishable under the Code or under any special or local law when it satisfied the conditions laid down in section 40 of the Code.\nThe \"general exceptions\" contained in sections 76–106 make an offence a non-offence. The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\n\nOf the Right of Private Defence"

      "content": "Every person has a right, subject to the restrictions contained in section 99, to defend\n—\n\nFirst.—His own body, and the body of any other person, against any offence affecting the human body;\nSecondly.—The property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit theft, robbery, mischief or criminal trespass.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section broadly specifies the offences against which the right of private defence can be exercised. Section 99 provides the limitations. These two sections combined together lay down the principles of the right of private defence.\nThe first clause of this section provides for the defence of body against any offence affecting the human body. The second provides for the defence of property against an act which amounts to the commission of certain offences.\nThere is no obligation upon a person entitled to exercise the right of private defence and to defend his person or property, to retire merely because his assailant threatens him with violence.337.\nExplaining the genesis of the rule, the Supreme Court has observed:338.\n\n\"It is important to bear in mind that self-preservation of one's life is the necessary concomitant of the right of life enshrined in Art. 21 of the Constitution of India, fundamental in nature, sacred, precious and inviolable. The importance and validity of the duty and right to self-preservation has a species in the right of self-defence in criminal law. Centuries ago thinkers of this great land conceived of such right and recognised it.\""

      "title": "Aggressor has no right of private defence.—",
      "content": "The right to defend does not include a right to launch an offensive or aggression.339. The right of private defence does not arise where the accused were the aggressors and the question of exceeding such right also does not arise.340. The Supreme Court added, in this case, that the right of self-defence arises when there is unexpected apprehension and one is taken unawares, or the accused happens to kill accidentally while using reasonable force private defence can be used to ward off unlawful force, or to prevent it, to avoid unlawful detention and to escape from such detention.341.\n\nWhen the father of the accused was trying to forcibly remove the gate of the thrashing ground of the deceased which was situated on the land of the deceased, his act amounted to an offence of 'mischief'. And, if the deceased while protecting his own property assaulted the father of the accused with a lathi, and the accused killed him in return, the accused could not claim the right of private defence of body of his father.342. In another case of the same kind the father of the accused was trying to pull out the gate of the deceased thrashing mill and on the deceased assaulting him in protection, the accused struck him dead. The right of private defence was not available in the circumstances.343. Where the parties went away from the property over which they were fighting, the death caused at that shifted place was not a justifiable exercise of the right of private defence.344. Where the accused succeeded in establishing their right to the property in dispute through the Court and then went to the field with a view\n\nto ask the other party to vacate the premises, it was held that it by itself did not render them to be aggressors for the purpose of denying them the benefit of right of self- defence.345.\nNumber of injuries is not always the safe criterion for determining who the aggressor is. The fact of injuries on the body of the accused does not by itself create the presumption that the accused was entitled to the right of private defence.346."

An assembly though lawful to begin with, may in the course of events become unlawful. So long as the accused persons were acting in exercise of right of private defence, their object was not unlawful and so there was no unlawful assembly but once they exceeded the right, the assembly ceased to be lawful and became an unlawful assembly. There too only such of the members of the assembly who shared the object of doing anything in excess of the exercise of right of private defence, alone would be liable to be punished for the acts committed in prosecution of the common object or for their individual unlawful acts.347."

    "section97.3": {
      "title": "Right of private defence to be pleaded.—",
      "content": "In a Supreme Court case it is stated,\n\nIt is well settled that even if an accused does not plead self-defence, it is open to the Court to consider such a plea if the same arises from materials on record.348.\n\nBut if no plea was entered on behalf of the accused and there were also no circumstances to show that the accused had probably the right of private defence, such a right could not be presumed on behalf of the accused on mere conjectures and surmises.349. A mere bald assertion without any evidence of facts and circumstances does not make out a case of private defence.350. The accused can, however, make out his plea by mere preponderance of probabilities from materials already on record and need not prove it to the hilt.351. Where by preponderance of probabilities the plea of private defence of the accused is plausible, benefit should be extended to the accused.352. Failure on the part of the prosecution to prove that the injuries on the person of the accused were not caused in self-defence, makes the defence of the accused probable and he is entitled to its benefit because he has not to prove his defence beyond reasonable doubt.353. Where the accused set up the plea of self- defence only during trial and not during investigation, it was held that this was not a ground for rejecting the plea.354. The accused on the observation of the High Court that the deceased was stabbed by the appellant, not in pursuance of any pre-planned attack, but being under the impression that the deceased was coming to attack him. The said observation cannot be read out of context to make out a case that the accused acted in self-defence. Such a plea is neither put forth in the statement under section 313 nor brought out in the cross examination of any of the prosecution witnesses.355. It is true that the right of private defence need not specifically be taken and in the event the Court on the basis of the materials on record is in a position to come to such a conclusion, despite some other plea having been raised, that such a case had been made out, it may act thereupon.356."

      "content": "Under circumstances which might have induced the belief that a man was cutting the throat of his wife, their son shot and killed his father. It was held that if the son had reasonable ground for believing and honestly believed that his act was necessary for the defence of his mother, the homicide was excusable.357. Where a girl was being sexually molested and her father hit the assailant resulting in consequential death, it was held that the father was entitled to the right of private defence irrespective of the fact whether the affair was with or without consent because of the girl being a minor.358. Where a man found his wife in compromising position with a person who sprang at the husband and caused him multiple injuries, some of them grievous, the husband thereafter gave a chopper blow resulting in the death of that person, it was held that the husband had not exceeded his right of private defence and was entitled to acquittal.359. Where the father of the accused was being given lathi blows by the complainant party, the accused fired from the licensed gun of his father to defend his father, it was held that he had acted in the exercise of the right of private defence whether the injuries caused to his father were simple or grievous.360. Trespassers on the property of another cannot get any benefit of right of private defence if they are attacked by the person in possession of the property.361. However no one including the true owner has a right to dispossess the trespasser by force if the trespasser is in settled possession of the land and in such a case unless he is evicted in due course of law, he is entitled to defend his possession even against the rightful owner. Such possession of the trespasser must extend over a sufficiently long period and acquiesced in by the true owner.362. Though law permits even a trespasser in settled possession to defend his possession but, it does not permit a person to take the law in his own hand to take forcible possession merely because he has obtained a favourable order under section 145 Cr PC, 1973. Such a person cannot claim private defence.363. Settled possession means such clear and effective physical possession that under the criminal law he, even if he is a trespasser, gets the right to defend his possession of the property against an attack even by the true owner.364. If no party is proved to be in settled possession, the question of exercise of right of private defence does not arise.365. Where the accused were in possession of the property and had grown the paddy, they were entitled to defend their possession by using reasonable force which in the instant case went up to causing of death as the party in possession was attacked and grievous blows were given to them.366. Where the prosecution party attacked the accused, his brothers and others with sharp edged weapons and lathis and when they tried to enter the latter's house, the accused fired at the crowd resulting in the death of a man and injuries to others, it was held that the accused had acted only in the exercise of the right of private defence and he was entitled to complete acquittal.367. Where the accused was fired at to dispel his party from attempting to rescue their friend from illegal police detention and an informer accompanying the police who tried to prevent them from snatching the police gun received fatal injuries, it was held that they were entitled to the right of private defence.368. Where a fatal injury was caused in consequence of hot exchange of words, the right of private defence was held to be not available.369. The Supreme Court has suggested that the number and nature of injuries sustained by the accused and the deceased in any case, may furnish good evidence to consider whether the accused was acting in private defence and, if so, whether he had exceeded his right. In the state of the evidence on record in that case and the number of injuries suffered by the accused, the Court did not accede to the contention that the right was not properly exercised.370."

Even if a trespass has been committed, in certain situations, right of private defence can be used to eject the trespassers.375. Where the accused had no right, title, interest or possession of the land in issue, right of private defence of property did not vest in him.376.\nWhere the complainant party was about 300 feet away from the disputed land and it was further found that the accused had not shown that there was any injury on the person of the accused, it was held that no right of private defence arose in favour of the accused. 377."

    "section97.7": {
      "title": "Open space.—",
      "content": "Though private defence is available in respect of criminal trespass or mischief as against the property owned by himself or of any other person, but criminal trespass is not enumerated as one of the offences under section 103 IPC, 1860. Therefore, the right of private defence of property will not extend to the causing of death of the person who committed such acts, if the act of trespass is in respect of an open land. Only a house-trespass committed under such circumstances as may reasonably cause apprehension that death or grievous hurt would be the consequence is enumerated as one of the offences under section 103.378. But in another judgment Supreme Court held that there is no law that right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to a dispute over an open space.379. Where the trespasser was in settled possession of the field in question, and the party who claimed ownership started ploughing the field, it was held that the trespasser (accused) had the right of private defence of his possession over property and offer resistance, but that he exceeded that right in causing death. His act fell under exception 2 to section 300 and punishable under section 304, Part I.380. Where a goat of the accused entered the field of another and he was trying to take it way, the other struck him with lathi blows and also his companion who came to his rescue. Only then the accused retaliated with lathi blows resulting in death. Supreme Court upheld the acquittal.381. The right is subject to restrictions imposed by section 99, the accused party was in possession of the land, the deceased party wanted to enter into possession forcibly. One of the aggressors was killed and another grievously hurt. The accused that caused the death was held to be guilty of exceeding the right of private defence. The acquittal of the person who caused grievous hurt with a spear was held to be not proper. He was liable to be convicted under section 326.382. Accused having not been in settled possession had no right to self-defence to defend the possession of the property.383. Occurrence took place on the land which was in possession of deceased. Accused cannot take the plea of private defence.384. No right of private defence of property to a person who was not in possession of the property.385.\nWhere the accused to a certain stage acted in defence of their property but exceeded it in breaking into the room of their victim, striking him with a lathi blow and also his wife and daughter who were also there in the room, the victim subsequently dying, their\n\nconviction was shifted from under section 302 to that under section 304 Part 1.386. The right of private defence of property (share in land) was held to have been exceeded when the deceased's side being armed with lathis only, the accused party fired at them with a gun, killing one and injuring others. The right of private defence was not available to them.387.\nWhere the finding of the Courts below was that the accused and his companions were aggressors because they assaulted the victim and his children when they came out to protest against cutting of their by the accused, it was held that the benefit of the right of private defence was not available to the accused.388.\nDefence of property may create circumstances ripening into the right of defence of person. This is so because even in defending property, the attack and counter-attack is likely to be on person. This was the situation in a case in which the accused while defending land over which they had possession; they became the victim of attack on person with sharp cutting weapons. It became their right to repel the danger of grievous hurt or even death and to use for that purpose reasonably appropriate force. Their right extended to cause death of the aggressors if that could be the only way of saving themselves.389."

    "section97.8": {
      "title": "CASES.—Exceeding private defence.—",
      "content": "The father of the accused was attacked by the deceased with a lathi and suffered a simple injury on his head, whereupon the accused in order to protect his father administered a fatal blow on the chest of the deceased with a ballam. It was held that though the accused had the right of private defence, he had obviously exceeded it and was, therefore, liable under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.390. A somewhat contrary view has, however, been taken by the Supreme Court in a later case where too the accused had exercised his right of private defence against a lathi blow on the head. Thus, in Deo Narain's case it has been held that the accused was justified in using his spear though the other party had aimed only a lathi blow on the head, which being a vulnerable part even a lathi blow could prove dangerous.391. It thus, appears that the part of the body against which the attack is directed is more important than the weapon used. Where the deceased attacked the accused with a stick and the accused retaliated by stabbing the former to death his offence fell under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860, as he had exceeded the right of private defence.392. Evidence on record showed that accused had received many injuries on his person, and exercised right of private defence of person in good faith. He had sustained four injuries on various parts of his body including on vital parts, thus, case would be covered by Exception 2 to section 300 of IPC, 1860. The nature of weapon used, circumstances in which incident took place, injuries on body of accused as well as deceased, showed that there was no premeditation. He had exercised his right of self-defence but having regard to the injuries inflicted by him on deceased, he exceeded same.393. Where the accused, a person with only one hand was attacked with a bamboo and sustained several injuries and then to ward off further attack gave only one blow with a pen-knife on the aggressor which unfortunately fell on a vital part resulting in his death, it could not be said that he had exceeded his right of private defence. For the accused it was a case of life or death struggle and his case, therefore, squarely fell within the ambit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860, and he could not be held guilty of any offence.394. In a sudden group clash over a house both sides received injuries and one person was killed. There was no prior enmity between two groups and the whole incident developed suddenly. Accused persons received quite a number of injuries, some on vital parts, and the prosecution was not able to explain those injuries. It was held that the accused could not be said to have exceeded the right of private defence. Their conviction was set aside.395. Two\n\narmed bullies of a locality raided a flat in a drunken state and demanded money from the inmates with the use of force. This amounted to the crime of extortion giving the inmates the right to defend themselves against the raiders. Both the raiders met their death in the process of the ensuing scuffle, it being not known nor capable of being ascertained who played what roll in the combat. The Supreme Court held that it could not be said of any one of them that he exceeded the right of private defence. Hence, they could not be convicted under section 302 read with section 34.396. The accused using his licenced gun fired only one shot after receiving a severe blow on his head fracturing his skull. It was held that he did not exceed his right of self-defence.397. A person had a lurking suspicion about illicit relations between his elder brother's wife and the accused and he caught hold of the accused when the latter visited their house to meet her. The accused inflicted knife injuries on him to extricate himself but did not inflict any further injury after freeing himself. It was held that the accused had not exceeded the right of private defence and was not guilty under section 307 for attempted murder.398. Where the accused fired a single gunshot at the deceased party to save his uncle who had received serious injuries in the attack made by the deceased party, the gun shot unfortunately proved fatal, the accused could not be said to have exceeded his right of self- defence.399. Where in a murder case over obstruction of water course, the victim assaulted the accused twice and injured him whereupon the accused inflicted a blow on him which proved fatal, the accused could not be said to have exceeded his right of private defence.400.\n\nA police party was looking for the accused to affect their arrest. The complainant party was helping the police. On being located, the accused party opened fire. The police withdrew after receiving injuries. Two members of the complainant party were killed. Even a runaway complainant was shot down. This showed that the attack continued even when all danger to the accused party had ceased. Thus, they exceeded the right of private defence. Conviction for murder was upheld.401.\nWhere the death occurred due to the firing resorted to as part of the self-defence, the same would amount to 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', which was committed without any pre-meditation in a sudden fight, in the heat of passion and upon a sudden quarrel and that the offender could not be said to have taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner, which would normally fall under Exception 4 of section 300 IPC, 1860.402."

      "title": "Burden on accused to probablise his defence.—",
      "content": "It is for the accused to establish the plea of private defence. He is not required to prove it beyond reasonable doubt. The Court has only to examine probabilities in appreciating the plea. In the present case, the accused had miserably failed to establish or even to probablise his defence. The deceased persons had merely asked them why they had cut the mature crop, when they became the victim of attack. They were unarmed.403. The accused need not take the plea of private defence explicitly. He can succeed in his plea if he is able to bring out from the evidence of the prosecution witness or other evidence of the prosecution witness or other evidence that the apparent criminal act was committed by him in exercise of private defence. The burden on the accused is not as onerous as that which lies on the prosecution. While the prosecution is required to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused can discharge his onus by establishing preponderance of probabilities.404.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person.

A K Chaudhary v State of Gujarat, 2006 Cr LJ 726 (Guj).\n\nTHE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n\nCHAPTER IV GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\nTHIS chapter has been framed in order to obviate the necessity of repeating in every penal clause a considerable number of limitations.\nThe word 'offence' in this chapter denotes a thing punishable under the Code or under any special or local law when it satisfied the conditions laid down in section 40 of the Code.\nThe \"general exceptions\" contained in sections 76–106 make an offence a non-offence. The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\n\nOf the Right of Private Defence"

Where officers of Delhi Municipal Corporation acting in good faith by virtue of powers delegated to them by the Commissioner attempted to seize the buffalo of the accused with a view to recover arrears of milk tax, the mere fact that no prior notice was issued to the accused as required by the Municipal Act would not make their act entirely outside the law and as such accused had no private defence under section 99 of the Code. The officers had merely erred in exercise of their powers.406. The clause applies to a case where an official has done wrongly, what he might have done rightly, but not to cases where the act could not have been done rightly at all by the official concerned.407. The clause applies where a public servant acts irregularly in the exercise of his powers, and not where he acts outside the scope of his powers.408. Where a police officer acting bona fide under colour of his office arrests a person but without authority, the person so arrested has no right of self- defence against the officer.409. If the act of a public servant is ultra vires the right of private defence may be exercised against him.410.

Where a raiding party organized by the official of the Municipal Corporation to round up stray cattle within the limits of the Corporation, was attacked when it had rounded up some cattle and was leading the cattle to the cattle pound, it was held that the act of the raiding party was fully justifiable by law and that the accused had no right of private defence.413.

      "title": "Third clause.—",
      "content": "The third clause of this section must be read with the first clause of section 105.418. It places an important restriction on the exercise of the right of defence. The right of private defence being granted for defence only, it must not and cannot legally be exercised when there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities. The right of private defence does not take the place of the functions of those public servants who are especially charged with the protection of life and property and the apprehension of offenders, and where the assistance of the public authorities can be procured, the right cannot be lawfully exercised. But the law does not intend that a person must run away to have recourse to the protection of public authorities when he is attacked instead of defending himself.419. A person in possession cannot be\n\nexpected to leave his property at the mercy of armed trespassers. Where there is imminent danger to the property and the person in possession apprehends substantial damage thereto, he is entitled to raise his own arms in defence and retaliate to keep away the attack without applying for State aid.420. Where the accused was in rightful possession of the property by virtue of a Court order; under section 145 Cr PC, 1973, he had every right to throw out the complainant party from the land and demolish the construction stealthily put up thereon.421. The important considerations which always arise in order to determine whether the action of the accused is covered by the right of private defence are, first, what is the nature of the apprehended danger, and, second, whether there was time to have recourse to the police authorities, always remembering that when both the parties are determined to fight and go up to the land fully armed in full expectation of an armed conflict in order to have a trial of strength the right of private defence disappears.422."

    "section99.7": {
      "title": "CASES.—Time to obtain protection of public authorities.—",
      "content": "The accused received information one evening that the complainants intended to go on his land on the following day, and uproot the corn sown in it. At about three o'clock next morning he was informed that the complainants had entered on his land and were ploughing up the corn. Thereupon he at once proceeded to the spot, followed by the remaining accused, and remonstrated with the complainants, who commenced an attack on the accused. In the fight which ensued, both sides received serious injuries, and the leader of the complainants' party was killed. It was held that the complainants being the aggressors, the accused had the right of private defence and that they were not bound to act on the information received on the previous evening and seek the protection of the public authorities, as they had no reason to apprehend a night attack on their property.423. In a case involving an old land dispute, one party (accused) offered resistance to prevent the other from ploughing the land and on refusal went up to the place where the other was sitting without arms and inflicted stick blows causing death, it was held that the accused was rightly convicted. The Court said that a rightful owner can defend his possession against any attempt to dislodge him, but that once a trespasser has established his foothold; resort should be had to public authorities.424.\nThe right of private defence does not extend to inflicting of more harm than necessary for the purpose of defence. The prosecution party, in this case, had gone to plough the land which was in the possession of the accused (appellant). The latter had time to go and report the matter to appropriate authorities constituted under the law. But instead of so doing, they brutally attacked the other party resulting in the death of three persons. Thus, there was no right of private defence. It was held that there was no warrant for converting the conviction from u/section 302 to section 304 Part II.425."
    },
    "section99.8": {
      "title": "Fourth clause.—",
      "content": "The right of private defence is restricted to not inflicting more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence. The amount of force necessarily depends on the circumstances of the case, and there is no protection if the harm is caused by excessive violence quite unnecessary to the case.426. For example, a person set by his master to watch a garden or yard is not at all justified in shooting at, or injuring in any way, persons who may come into those premises, even in the night. He ought first to see whether he could not take measures for their apprehension.427. The measure of self-defence must always be proportionate to the quantum of force used by the attacker and which it is necessary to repel.428. In dealing with the question as to\n\nwhether more force is used than is necessary or than was justified by the prevailing circumstances, it would be inappropriate to adopt tests of detached objectivity of a Court room. The means which a threatened person adopts or the force which he uses should not be weighed in golden scales.429. Though a person exercising his right of private defence is not expected to modulate his defence step by step or tier by tier, yet it is necessary to see that it is not totally disproportionate to the injury sought to be averted, e.g., to ward off a slap one cannot fire a gun. Thus, where the father of the accused was allegedly assaulted with lathis which resulted in simple injuries, the accused was not justified in firing his gun and thereby killing the attacker. In such a case it could not be said that there was a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt within the meaning of clause (1) of section 100, IPC, 1860.430. But at the same time it should also be remembered that if a man has real justification to exercise his right of private defence, he cannot be held liable if he slightly exceeds his right of private defence, e.g., where face to face with a murderous attack he fires two shots in quick succession, for these things cannot be weighed in golden scales.431. The right of private defence should not be allowed to be pleaded or availed of as pretext for a vindictive, aggressive or retributive purpose.432."

They tried to snatch the police gun. A police informer intervened and died of injuries received in the process. The right of private defence was held to be not exceeded.433. In another case the Supreme Court accepted the defence version that there were four assailants who had come well prepared to assault at the door of their house. In such a situation accused persons could have a reasonable apprehension of death or at least of grievous hurt. It was a case of single gunshot which was not repeated. Therefore, it cannot be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of private defence in any manner.434.\n\nIn view of the fact that the accused was pursued, that he only picked up the weapon when he was chased and that he used it only once, his sentence was reduced to three years and nine months.435."

Where the injuries suffered by the accused were of simple nature than those caused by him to the deceased persons and he went even to the extent of preventing a witness from carrying the victim to a hospital, it was held that the accused was an aggressor and was, therefore, not entitled to the right of private defence.444. Where, on the other hand, two drunk and armed raiders demanded money from the residents of a flat and in face to face with the inmates who resisted them, lost their lives, it being not known which inmate played what role, the Supreme Court held that it could not be said that more harm was caused than was necessary.445. Where the accused caused death in order to repel an attack by a party armed with lethal weapons and which had already caused injuries to the accused, it was held that the accused did not exceed his rights as it was not possible for him to have weighed in golden scales in the heat of the moment the number of injuries required to overcome the attack.446. Where the accused continued to assault the deceased even after he fell to the ground, the possibility of causing injuries in exercise of his right of private defence was ruled out.447.\n\nWhere the accused received an injury on his neck first, the right of private defence was held to have arisen. But it was shown that three injuries were caused in return one of them entering deep into the chest and causing death. The right of private defence was held to have been exceeded.

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\n\nOf the Right of Private Defence"

      "title": "When the right of private defence of the body extends to causing death.",
      "content": "The right of private defence of the body extends, under the restrictions mentioned in the last preceding section, to the voluntary causing of death or of any other harm to the assailant, if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right be of any of the descriptions hereinafter enumerated, namely:—\nFirst.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that death will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;\nSecondly.—Such an assault as may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such assault;\nThirdly.—An assault with the intention of committing rape; Fourthly.—An assault with the intention of gratifying unnatural lust; Fifthly.—An assault with the intention of kidnapping or abducting;\nSixthly.—An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person, under circumstances which may reasonably cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for his release.\n449.[Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act.]\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThe law authorizes a man who is under a reasonable apprehension that his life is in danger or his body in risk of grievous hurt to inflict death upon his assailant either when the assault is attempted or directly threatened, but the apprehension must be reasonable and the violence inflicted must not be greater than is reasonably necessary for the purpose of self-defence. It must be proportionate to and commensurate with the quality and character of the act it is intended to meet and what is done in excess is not protected. Where the accused was attacked by three persons and sustained an injury on the forehead, a vital part, he had reasonable apprehension of some hurt to be caused to him and had the right of self-defence but had exceeded by causing more harm to his assailants than needed. He was liable under section 304, Part I, and not under section 302.450. Where after receiving nine injuries, two on vital parts, the accused fired one shot from his gun which hit fatally an innocent person, the right of private defence extending to cause death was still available to the accused. His conviction under section 304, Part I was set aside.451. Where the complainant's party had deliberately gathered near the house of the accused and scolded them and caused injuries to his father, the accused was held justified in exercising the right of private defence to defend his father and his conviction under section 300 was set aside.452. It is the reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt that gives rise to the right of private defence under clauses (1) and (2) of section 100, IPC, 1860., and it has got nothing to do with the actual injury that the person exercising the right of private defence has suffered, which may or may not be grievous.453. Where the accused fails to make out a case of reasonable apprehension, he cannot claim the right of private defence.454. Where the life of the accused was not endangered by the ladies armed with broom sticks and 'chappals', the accused was not entitled to stab one of the ladies to death in exercise of right of private defence.455.\n\nThe extended right of private defence to the extent of causing death of the assailant arises only if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right is of one of the kinds mentioned in this section.456. Following some earlier rulings, the Supreme Court has re-emphasised that the mere fact of the accused sustaining some injuries in the course of the same transaction does not make it out conclusively that the accused had the occasion to cause death in private defence.457. Where the attacking party chanced to get at the wife of the accused and the latter pounced upon them with a weapon attacking one of them which was warded off, another came forward and the accused successfully struck him and he died, the accused was held to be within his rights.458. As against this where two were fighting with lathis and the brother of one of them, who was outside the danger, struck a lathi blow to the other killing him, he was held to be guilty under section 304-I.459. In a communal tension, both sides pelted stones. The accused fired a gun shot causing death of a person of the other group though no one had sustained any injury as a result of pelting of stones by the other group. It was held that the accused had no occasion to act under the right of private defence.460.\n\nIn order to justify the act of causing death of assailant, the accused has simply to satisfy the Court that there was reasonable apprehension of death or grievous hurt. Question whether the apprehension was reasonable or not is a question of fact depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case and no straitjacket formula can be prescribed in this regard. Weapon used, the manner and nature of assault and other surrounding circumstances should be taken into account while evaluating whether the apprehension was justified or not. In the instant case, accused G was assaulted on head by a sharp-edged weapon which caused a bone-deep injury. As per the defence version there were four assailants who had come well prepared at the door of accused's house to commit assault. Reasonable apprehension of death or at least of grievous hurt, therefore, could not be ruled out. In such a situation, if single gunshot was fired it could not be said that the accused persons had exceeded their right of private defence in any manner.461."

      "title": "'Abducting'.—",
      "content": "On a plain reading of clause fifth of this section, there does not seem to be any reason for holding that the word 'abducting' used in the clause means anything more than what is defined as \"abduction\" in section 362. All that the clause requires is that there should be an assault which is an offence against the human body and that assault should be with the intention of abducting, and whenever these elements are present the clause will be applicable.462. Thus, a woman could not be taken away by force even by her own husband from a paramour's house and if in these circumstances the paramour and his brother killed the husband to prevent her abduction by the husband, they would be protected by sub-clause (5) of section 100 of the Penal Code.463. Here law seems to be contrary to our social conscience, but this interpretation is perfectly in accord with the language of section 100, IPC, 1860, and the decision of the Supreme Court in Viswanath's case464. where too the husband was put to death by a clean stab by his brother-in-law as he was trying to take away his wife by force from his father-in-law's house and in the process had merely dragged his unwilling wife to some distance."

They assembled in front of the house of the accused. They came as aggressors. The accused suffered a bone deep injury on his head. The accused fired a single gunshot which caused death of one of the members on the prosecution side. The Court held that the right of private defence was not exceeded. The accused was given the benefit of doubt.468.\n\nWhere the victim was throwing broken bricks at the accused who received simple injuries and the accused fired at him with his gun, it was held that he exceeded the right of private defence. There was no justification for using the gun in such as to cause death. Conviction under section 304 Part I was restored.469.

The deceased came to his land and asked the accused party to get the land measured and also tried to dislodge a pole fixed by them. There was no imminent danger to person on property from any act of the deceased. No injuries caused to anybody.

The burden of proving the right of private defence is not as onerous as that of the prosecution to prove its case. Preponderance of probabilities in favour of the defence is enough to discharge the burden.476. While the prosecution is required to\n\nprove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the accused need not establish his plea of self-defence to the hilt and may discharge onus by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of that plea on basis of material on record, injuries received by an accused, imminence of threat to his safety, injuries caused by accused and circumstances whether accused had time to have recourse to public authorities were held to relevant factors. But number of injuries is not always considered to be a safe criterion for determining who the aggressor was. Whenever injuries are on the body of the accused person, presumption need not necessarily be raised that accused person had caused injuries in his defence. Defence has to further to show that injuries so caused on accused probabilise version of private defence. Non-explanation of injuries sustained by the accused at about the time of occurrence or in course of the altercation is a very important circumstance but mere non-explanation may not affect prosecution case in all cases.477.\nThe burden stands discharged by showing preponderance of probabilities in favour of the plea of the accused either by himself adducing positive evidence or by referring to circumstances transpiring from prosecution evidence itself. Proof beyond reasonable doubt is not required. The Court can consider the plea even if not taken by the accused if the material on record makes it available for consideration.478."

Act 13 of 2013, section 2 (w.e.f. 3-2-2013).\n\nTHE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n\nCHAPTER IV GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\nTHIS chapter has been framed in order to obviate the necessity of repeating in every penal clause a considerable number of limitations.\nThe word 'offence' in this chapter denotes a thing punishable under the Code or under any special or local law when it satisfied the conditions laid down in section 40 of the Code.\nThe \"general exceptions\" contained in sections 76–106 make an offence a non-offence. The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\n\nOf the Right of Private Defence"

      "title": "When such right extends to causing any harm other than death.",
      "content": "If the offence be not of any of the descriptions enumerated in the last preceding section, the right of private defence of the body does not extend to the voluntary causing of death to the assailant, but does extend, under the restrictions mentioned in section 99, to the voluntary causing to the assailant of any harm other than death.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nAny harm short of death can be inflicted in exercising the right of private defence in any case which does not fall within the provisions of section 100. Thus, where only some mischief was caused to the factory and some brickbats were thrown by agitating workers, the owner of the factory was not justified in killing a worker by firing a shot from his revolver. As there was no apprehension of death or grievous hurt to his person, the accused could not get the benefit of clauses (1) and (2) of section 100 or section 103, IPC, 1860. He had only a limited right of private defence to cause any other harm than death within the meaning of section 101, IPC, 1860, and as such having exercised his right of private defence he was liable to be convicted under section 304-Part I, IPC, 1860.480. The accused was hit by a single brickbat or a stone piece and suffered a simple head-injury. After sometime he fired at the unarmed assailant causing grievous injury to his abdomen. The Supreme Court held that keeping in mind his simple hurt and the time gap between that and the gunshot wound caused by him, his action was a retaliation rather than act of private defence. His conviction under section 326 was accordingly upheld.481. The right of private defence was held to have been exceeded where a member of the opposite side was killed after snatching his pistol.482. The person who died came along with his brothers to stage a fight with the accused because of an earlier act of insult on the part of the accused. A single stab wound was administered to him, which fell upon his lower abdomen, of which he died. The accused and his wife were also injured in the process. It was held that the accused had not exceeded his right of private defence.483.\n\nWhen dealing with questions relating to right of private defence of the body this section and section 100 should be read together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

      "title": "Commencement and continuance of the right of private defence of the body.",
      "content": "The right of private defence of the body commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section indicates when the right of private defence of the body commences and till what time it continues. The right commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence, although the offence may not have been committed, but not until that there is that reasonable apprehension. The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body continues.484. It commences and continues as long as danger to body lasts. The extent to which the exercise of the right will be justified will depend not on the actual danger but on whether there was reasonable apprehension of such danger. There must be an attempt or threat and consequent thereon an apprehension of danger; but it is not a mere idle threat, or every apprehension of a rash or timid mind, that will justify the exercise of the right. Reasonable ground for the apprehension is requisite. Suppose the threat to proceed from a woman or child and to be addressed to a strong man, in such a case there could hardly be a reasonable apprehension. Present and imminent danger seems to be meant.485. The person exercising a right of private defence must consider whether the threat to his person or his property is real and immediate. If he reaches the conclusion reasonably that the threat is immediate and real, he is entitled to exercise his right. In the exercise of his right, he must use force necessary for the purpose and he must stop using the force as soon as the threat has disappeared. So long as the threat lasts and the right of private defence can be legitimately exercised; if the danger is continuing, the right is there; if the danger or the apprehension about it has ceased to exist there is no longer the right of private defence.486. Right commences, as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt, or threat, or commit the offence, although the offence may not have been committed but not until that there is that reasonable apprehension. The right lasts so long as the reasonable apprehension of the danger to the body continues.487. There is no right to inflict punishment on the wrong-doer for his past act after the apprehension has ceased to exist. The right of defence ends with the necessity for it. So where the deceased was fleeing for his life, there was no justification to shoot him down. This would be a sheer case of murder and nothing else.488. Where the testimony of the independent witness showed that the accused chased one of the deceased who fled away from the scene of occurrence and killed him, they could not be said to have right of private defence as regards the killing of such deceased.489. Though the nature of apprehension depends upon the nature of weapon intended to be used or used, it cannot be said that as the complainant's party had only used lathis, the accused was not justified in using his spear especially when a blow with a lathi was aimed at a vulnerable part like the head.490.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\".

Act No. 29 of 1970, s. 2,\nw.e.f. 17-7-1970.\n\nIn its application to the State of Uttar Pradesh, In section 103, after clause Fourthly, add the following clause, namely:—\nFifthly.—Mischief by fire or any explosive substance committed on—\n\n(a) Any property used or intended to be used for the purpose of Government, or any local authority or other corporation owned or controlled by the Government, or\n(b) any railway as defined in clause (4) of section 3 of the Indian Railways Act, 1890 or railways stores as defined in the Railways Stores (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1955;,or\n\n(c) any transport vehicle as defined in clause (33) of section 2 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nDeath caused in defence of property.—Section 100 enumerates the cases in which the right of private defence of the body extends to the causing of death; this section enumerates the cases in which it extends to the causing of death in defence of property.\nA person employed to guard the property of his employer is protected by sections 97, 99, 103 and 105 if he causes death in safeguarding his employer's property when there is reason to apprehend that the person whose death has been caused was about to commit one of the offences mentioned in this section or to attempt to commit one of those offences. A person whose duty it is to guard a public building is in the same position, that is to say, it is his duty to protect the property of his employer and he may take such steps for this purpose as the law permits. The fact that the property to be guarded is public property does not extend the protection given to a guard. Therefore, a police constable on guard duty at a magazine or other public building is not entitled to fire at a person merely because the latter does not answer his challenge.491. The deceased, none of whom was in possession of any dangerous weapons, were harvesting crop on a plot of land with peaceful intention under the protection of police. The accused who claimed the crops did not approach the authorities for redress, although they had time to do so, sent away the police constables by a ruse and then attacked the deceased with guns and other dangerous weapons and shot them down at close range. It was held by the Supreme Court that the acts of the deceased did not amount to robbery and that the accused had no right of private defence of property.492. The accused was in possession of the plots which were under litigation. Finding his opponent, a blind man, getting the plots ploughed, the accused asked him to stop ploughing. On this, 8–10 persons armed with spears and 'lathis' proceeded towards him. The accused fired a shot from his gun causing death of his opponent, the blind man. The Court observed that a blind villager could not be thought of going to take possession of the plots without mobilising enough man power to deal with resistance likely to be put up by his adversary. It was held that in the circumstances the right of private defence of the person became available to the accused.493.\nIn the words of the Supreme Court, the High Court committed an error in relation to the plea of self-defence raised on behalf of the accused to the effect that the incident took place at an open space. There is no law that the right of self-defence cannot be exercised in relation to an open space.494. Reasonable force may be used in defence of property. It would not in general be reasonable to kill in defence of property alone.495."

The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6.

Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860.

An offender is to be considered as having affected his retreat when he has once got off having escaped immediate pursuit not having been made. A recapture of the plundered property, while it is in course of being carried away, is authorized, for the taking and retaking is one transaction. But when the offence has been committed and the property removed, a recapture after an interval of time by the owner or by other persons on his behalf, however justifiable, cannot be deemed an exercise of the right of defence of property. The recovery which the section contemplates seems to be a recovery either immediate or made before the offender has reached his final retreat.503. Where the appellants followed up tracks purporting to be those of their stolen cattle, and prior to the arrival of the police (for whose assistance one of their party had ridden away) proceeded to the complainants' village and fired at them, it was held that the appellants' right of private defence of their property had been put an end to by the successful retreat of the thieves, and that their\n\nalleged rediscovery of the cattle in the complainants' possession could not revive that right.504."

Balakee Jolahed, (1868) 10 WR (Cr) 9; Gulbadan v State, (1885) PR No. 25 of 1885.\n\nTHE INDIAN PENAL CODE\n\nCHAPTER IV GENERAL EXCEPTIONS\n\nTHIS chapter has been framed in order to obviate the necessity of repeating in every penal clause a considerable number of limitations.\nThe word 'offence' in this chapter denotes a thing punishable under the Code or under any special or local law when it satisfied the conditions laid down in section 40 of the Code.\nThe \"general exceptions\" contained in sections 76–106 make an offence a non-offence. The \"general exceptions\" enacted by Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) are of universal application and for the sake of brevity of expression, instead of repeating in every section that the definition is to be taken subject to the exceptions, the Legislature by section 6 IPC, 1860 enacted that all the definitions must be regarded as subject to the general exceptions. Therefore, general exceptions are part of definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860, but the burden to prove their existence lied on the accused.1.\nThe following acts are exempted under the Code from criminal liability:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a Court (section 78).\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years, but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85) and partially exempted (section 86).\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of sufferer (section 88).\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person by or by the consent of guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n17. Act causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Act done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nThe above exceptions, strictly speaking, come within the following seven categories:—\n\n1. Judicial acts (section. 77, 78).\n2. Mistake of fact (sections 76, 79).\n3. Accident (section 80).\n4. Absence of criminal intent (sections 81–86, 92–94).\n5. Consent (sections 87, 90).\n6. Trifling acts (section 95).\n7. Private defence (sections 96–106).\n\nOnus of proving exception lies on accused.—When a person is accused of any offence, the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing the case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code, or within any special exception or proviso contained in any other part of the same Code, or in any law defining the offence, is upon him, and the Court shall presume the absence of such circumstances.2.\nAlthough the law lays down that the onus of proving circumstances which give the benefit of a general exception to an accused person lies on him, and in the absence of evidence the presumption is against the accused, this does not mean that the accused must lead evidence. If it is apparent from the evidence on the record, whether produced by the prosecution or by the defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is open to the Court to consider whether the evidence proves to its satisfaction that the accused comes within the exception.3.\nApplicability of General exceptions during investigation.—In considering that whether accusation made in the complaint makes out a case for commission of offence or not, the police while reaching the prima facie satisfaction of suspecting the commission of cognizable offence, cannot ignore the general exception as provided under IPC, 1860 as per Chapter IV of IPC, 1860. If on the basis of the allegation made in the complaint, the case is falling in general exceptions, it can be said that the action cannot be termed as an offence.4. Investigating officer is bound to investigate and confirm that despite what is contained in the \"General Exceptions\"; acts committed by accused shall constitute offence under IPC, 1860. This shall be done, by virtue of section 6 of IPC, 1860. In the light of section 6 of IPC, 1860, definition of every offence is to be understood subject to the \"General Exceptions\". Therefore, investigation shall not confine merely to the acts committed by a person. Depending on facts and circumstances of each case, many other relevant facts also have to be investigated into, in the light of the provisions contained in \"General Exceptions\". It is only then that an investigating officer will be able to confirm whether the act committed by a person is an offence or not, as defined in IPC, 1860 subject to what is contained in \"General Exceptions\". Further, the category of self-defence falling in general exception would fall in a different category than the general exceptions, which are provided in the very chapter for exercise of the statutory duty or lawful power either under the mistake of law or fact or mistaken belief of law or fact.5.\n\nOf the Right of Private Defence"

      "title": "Abetment of a thing.",
      "content": "A person abets the doing of a thing, who— First.—Instigates any person to do that thing; or\nSecondly.—Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing; or\nThirdly.—Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.\n\nExplanation 1.—A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA, a public officer is authorised by a warrant from a Court of Justice to apprehend Z. B, knowing that fact and also that C is not Z, wilfully represents to A that C is Z, and thereby intentionally causes A to apprehend C. Here B abets by instigation the apprehension of C.\nExplanation 2.—Whoever, either prior to or at the time of the commission of an act, does anything in order to facilitate the commission of that act, and thereby facilitates the commission thereof, is said to aid the doing of that act.\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS.—\n\nIn common parlance, the word 'abet' means assistance, co-operation and encouragement and includes wrongful purpose. In Corpus Juris Secundum, vol I at p 306, the meaning of the word 'abet' is given as follows:\n'To abet' has been defined as meaning to aid; to assist or to give aid; to command, to procure, or to counsel; to countenance; to encourage, counsel, induce, or assist; to encourage or to set another on to commit.\nUsed with 'aid'. The word 'abet' is generally used with the word 'aid' and similar words.\n\nIn order to bring a person abetting the doing of a thing, under any one of the clauses enumerated under section 107, it is not only necessary to prove that the person who has abetted has taken part in the steps of the transactions but also in some way or other he has been connected with those steps of the transactions which are criminal. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act which is actually done by the person whom he abets.1.\nFor the purposes of the first two clauses of this section it is immaterial whether the person instigated commits the offence or not or the persons conspiring together\n\nactually carry out the object of the conspiracy.2. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.3. The Court noted that in Faguna Kanta Nath v State of Assam4. the appellant was tried for an offence under section 165A for having abetted the commission of an offence by an officer, who was acquitted, and it was held that the appellant's conviction for abetment was also not maintainable. But subsequently in Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar,5. it was considered not desirable to hold that an abettor cannot be punished if the person actually committing the offence is acquitted. The Court said that the abettor's guilt depends upon the nature of the offence abetted and the manner of abetment. It is only in cases of intentional aiding that the abettor would have to be acquitted with the principal offender.6. Following this state of the rulings the Supreme Court ordered the acquittal of the single abettor when the main offender as also all other abettors already stood acquitted.\n\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated that before anybody can be punished for abetment of suicide, it must be proved that the death in question was a suicidal death.7.\nThe Supreme Court held that the offence of abetment is a separate and independent offence. Where the offence is committed in consequence of the abetment but there is no provision for punishment of such abetment, the abettor is to be punished along with the offender for the original offence.8.\nAbetment is constituted by:\n\n(1) instigating a person to commit an offence; or\n(2) engaging in a conspiracy to commit it; or\n(3) intentionally aiding a person to commit it.\n\nThe offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets and not upon the act which is done by the person who has abetted. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided under section 107, Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860. However, the words uttered in a fit of anger or omission without any intention cannot be termed as instigation.9."

Negligence or carelessness or the facilitation cannot be termed to be abetment so as to punish the guilty as per the provision of penal laws.10. In order to constitute abetment, the abettor must be shown to have \"intentionally\" aided to commission of the crime. Mere proof, that the crime charged could not have been committed without involvement and/or interposition of the alleged abettor is not enough compliance with the requirements of section 107. It is not enough that an act on the part of the alleged abettor happens to facilitate the commission of the crime. Intentional aiding and therefore active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the third paragraph of section 107.11."

      "title": "Sting operation, mens rea and abetment.—",
      "content": "In typical sting operations, though the operation is carried in the public interest, the same is generally done by instigating the accused. Hence the victim, who is otherwise innocent, is lured into committing a crime on the assurance of absolute secrecy and confidentiality of the transaction raising the potential question as to how such a victim can be held responsible for the crime which he would not have committed but for the enticement. In such circumstances, should the individual, i.e., the sting operator be held criminally liable for commission of the offence that is inherent and inseparable from the process by which commission of another offence is sought to be established? What about the operator who has mens rea or guilty intention to commit the offence? These are puzzling questions when there is an allegation that the sting operator is alleged to have committed the abetment of the offence. The Supreme Court in Rajat Prasad v CBI,12. observed that a crime does not stand obliterated or extinguished merely because its commission is claimed to be in public interest. At the same time, the criminal intent (mens rea) behind the commission of the act will have to be established before the liability of the person charged with the commission of crime can be adjudged. The Court held that the questions whether the sting operation is a journalistic exercise and any criminal intent can be imputed are to be answered by the evidence of the parties.\n(1) Abetment by instigation.—First clause.—A person is said to 'instigate' another to an act, when he actively suggests or stimulates him to the act by any means of language, direct or indirect, whether it takes the form of express solicitation, or of hints, insinuation or encouragement.13."

    "section107.3": {
      "title": "\"Instigate\" Meaning.—",
      "content": "Instigation is to goad, urge forward, provoke, incite or encourage to do \"an act\". To satisfy the requirement of \"instigation\", though it is not necessary that actual words must be used to that effect or what constitutes \"instigation\" must necessarily and specifically be suggestive of the consequence. Yet a reasonable certainty to incite the consequence must be capable of being spelt out. Where the accused had, by his acts or omission or by a continued course of conduct, created such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, in which case, \"instigation\" may have to be inferred. A word uttered in a fit of anger or emotion without intending the consequences to actually follow, cannot be said to be instigation. Thus, to constitute 'instigation', a person who instigates another has to provoke, incite, urge or encourage the doing of an act by the other by \"goading\" or 'urging forward'. The dictionary meaning of the word \"goad\" is \"a thing that stimulates someone into action; provoke to action or reaction … to keep irritating or annoying somebody until he reacts\".14. The word \"instigate\" literally means to provoke, incite, urge on or bring about by persuasion to do anything. The abetment may be by instigation, conspiracy or intentional aid as provided in the three clauses of the section.15. Instigate means the active role played by a person with a view to stimulate another person to do the thing. In order to hold a person guilty of abetting it must be established that he had intentionally done something which amounted to instigating another to do a thing.16. Instigation may be of an unknown person.17. A mere acquiescence or permission does not amount to instigation.18."

The illustration is an example of instigation by 'wilful misrepresentation'. Instigation by 'wilful concealment' is where some duty exists which obliges a person to disclose a fact. The explanation to section 107 says that any wilful misrepresentation or wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, may also come within the contours of \"abetment\".19."

      "content": "Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.21. Deceased committed suicide by hanging himself because of alleged illicit relationship between his wife and the accused. Accused took the wife of deceased away from the house of her brother and kept her with him for four days. There is definitely a proximity and nexus between the conduct and behaviour of the accused and wife of deceased with that of suicide committed by the deceased.22. Where a married girl committed suicide by burning herself in her in-law's house, her in-laws were held guilty of abetment because they were persistently torturing her for inadequate dowry and had gone to the extent of accusing her of illegitimate pregnancy.23. \"All these tortures and taunts\", Ray J said,24. \"Caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on her person and setting it afire.\" In another case of the same kind a husband persistently demanded more money from his wife, quarrelling with her everyday. On the fateful day when she happened to say that death would have been better than this, she heard only this in reply that her husband would feel relieved if she ended her life. Immediately thereafter she set herself on fire. The husband was held guilty of instigating her to commit suicide.25. Mere harassment of wife by husband due to differences per se does not attract section 306 read with section 107, IPC, 1860.26.\n\nDemand of loan amount by accused from deceased itself does not come within the scope of abetment as defined under section 107.27. Goading and intimidating a debtor with a view to pressurising him for repayment of the loan which brought about a suicide by the debtor immediately thereafter, was held as not amounting to abetment of suicide and, therefore, no case under section 306 read with section 34 was made out.28.\nThe accused told the other person \"to go and die\". It was held that this would not in itself satisfy the ingredients of instigation. Instigation has to be with mens rea. The suicide was committed two days after the quarrel between the accused and the deceased. This also showed that the suicide was not the direct result of the quarrel. The suicide note indicated that her husband was a frustrated man and given to drinking and suffered from great stress and depression.29.\n\nThe accused, a Motor Vehicle Inspector, beat up and abused a driver for not being able to produce necessary papers. The driver committed suicide. The Court said that it was not shown that he was guilty of any act of abetment within the meaning of section 107. The charge against him under section 107 was quashed.30."

In order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be established that:\n\n(i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward direction; and\n(ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above.

      "title": "Test.—",
      "content": "No straight-jacket formula can be laid down to find out as to whether in a particular case there has been instigation which force the person to commit suicide. In a particular case, there may not be direct evidence in regard to instigation which may have direct nexus to suicide. Therefore, in such a case, an inference has to be drawn from the circumstances and it is to be determined whether circumstances had been such which in fact had created the situation that a person felt totally frustrated and committed suicide.35.\n(2) Abetment by conspiracy.—Second clause.—'Conspiracy' consists in the agreement of two or more [persons] to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means. So long as such a design rests in intention only, it is not indictable. When two agree to carry it into effect, the very plot is an act in itself, and the act of each of the parties, promise against promise, actus contra actum, capable of being enforced, if lawful, is punishable if for a criminal object or for the use of criminal means.36. It is not necessary that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is sufficient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.37. Where parties concert together, and have a common object, the act of\n\none of the parties, done in furtherance of the common object and in pursuance of the concerted plan, is the act of all.38.\nBefore the introduction of Chapter V-A, conspiracy, except in cases provided for by sections 121A, 311, 400, 401 and 402 of the Code, was a mere species of abetment when an act or an illegal omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and amounted to a distinct offence for each distinct offence abetted by conspiracy.39. For an offence under the second clause of this section a mere combination of persons or agreement is not enough; an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of the conspiracy. But for an offence under section 120A a mere agreement is enough if the agreement is to commit an offence.40."
    },
    "section107.10": {
      "title": "Abetment and Conspiracy-Difference between.—",
      "content": "Criminal conspiracy postulates an agreement between two or more persons to do, or cause to be done, an illegal act or an act which is not illegal, by illegal, means. It differs from other offences because mere agreement is made an offence even if no step is taken to carry out that agreement. Though there is close association of conspiracy with incitement and abetment the substantive offence of criminal conspiracy is somewhat wider in amplitude than abetment by conspiracy as contemplated under section 107, IPC, 1860.41. There is no analogy between section 120B and section 109, IPC, 1860. There may be an element of abetment in a conspiracy, but conspiracy is something more than an abetment. Offences created by sections 109 and 120B, iPC, 1860 are quite distinct and there is no warrant for limiting the prosecution to only one element of conspiracy, that is, abetment when the allegation is that what a person did was something over and above that.42.\n(3) Abetment by aid.—Third clause.—By act.—A person, it is trite, abets by aiding, when by any act done either prior to, or at the time of the commission of an act, he intends to facilitate and does in fact facilitate the commission thereof, would attract the third clause of section 107 of the IPC, 1860. Doing something for the offender is not abetment. Doing something with knowledge so as to facilitate him to commit the crime or otherwise would constitute abetment.43. In order to constitute abetment by aiding within the meaning of the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860 the abettor must be shown to have intentionally aided the commission of the crime. A person may invite another casually or for a friendly purpose and that may facilitate the murder of the invitee. But unless it is shown that the invitation was extended with a view to facilitate the commission of the murder, it cannot be said that the person extending the invitation had abetted the murder. The language used in the section is \"intentionally aids\" and therefore, active complicity is the gist of the offence of abetment under the third paragraph of section 107, IPC, 1860.44. Abetment includes instigating any person to do a thing or engaging with one or more persons in any conspiracy for the doing of a thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, or intentional aid by any act or illegal omission to the doing of that thing. On facts held, in the instant case, there was no direct evidence to establish that the appellant either aided or instigated the deceased to commit suicide or entered into any conspiracy to aid her in committing suicide.45. Where the principal offender killed the victim with a knife provided by the defendant who later claimed that he thought the knife would be used only to threaten, the defendant's conviction for murder was upheld, the Court of Appeal saying that the trial judge was correct to direct the jury that the defendant could be so convicted if he contemplated that the principal offender might kill or cause serious bodily harm to the victim as part of their joint enterprise.46. It is not necessary that the abettor should be present at the place of the occurrence. It is also not necessary to show that the secondary party to a conspiracy to\n\nmurder intended the victim to be killed provided it is proved that he contemplated or foresaw the event as a real or substantial risk. Mere absence from the scene of the crime cannot amount to unequivocal communication of withdrawal from the enterprise. The accused was recruited with certain others by a person to kill his wife. At a predetermined time she was taken to the agreed place and killed. The accused was not present when the killing took place. It was held that he was rightly convicted in that he had lent encouragement and assistance before the commission of the crime.47."

The Supreme Court has never laid down in Satvir Singh57. that under no circumstance an offence under section 306 read with section 511, IPC, 1860 can be committed. The Supreme Court did not have occasion to consider whether a conviction for an offence of attempt to abet the commission of suicide is punishable under section 306 read with section 511, IPC, 1860.58.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    },
    "section108": {
      "title": "Abettor.",
      "content": "A person abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence, or the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor.\nExplanation 1.—The abetment of the illegal omission of an act may amount to an offence although the abettor may not himself be bound to do that act.\nExplanation 2.—To constitute the offence of abetment it is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed, or that the effect requisite to constitute the offence should be caused.\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A instigates B to murder C. B refuses to do so. A is guilty of abetting B to commit murder.\n\n(b) A instigates B to murder D. B in pursuance of the instigation stabs D. D recovers from the wound. A is guilty of instigating B to commit murder.\nExplanation 3.—It is not necessary that the person abetted should be capable by law of committing an offence, or that he should have the same guilty intention or knowledge as that of the abettor, or any guilty intention or knowledge.\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A, with a guilty intention, abets a child or a lunatic to commit an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, and having the same intention as A. Here A, whether the act be committed or not, is guilty of abetting an offence.\n\n(b) A, with the intention of murdering Z, instigates B, a child under seven years of age, to do an act which causes Z's death. B, in consequence of the abetment, does the act in the absence of A and thereby causes Z's death. Here though B was not capable by law of committing an offence, A is liable to be punished in the same manner as if B had been capable by law of committing an offence, and had committed murder, and he is therefore subject to the punishment of death.\n\n(c) A instigates B to set fire to a dwelling-house. B, in consequence of the unsoundness of his mind, being incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that he is doing what is wrong or contrary to law, sets fire to the house in consequence of A's instigation. B has committed no offence, but A is guilty of abetting the offence of setting fire to a dwelling-house, and is liable to the punishment provided for that offence.\n\n(d) A, intending to cause a theft to be committed, instigates B to take property\n\nbelonging to Z out of Z's possession. A induces B to believe that the property belongs to A. B takes the property out of Z's possession, in good faith, believing it to be A's property. B, acting under this misconception, does not take dishonestly, and therefore does not commit theft. But A is guilty of abetting theft, and is liable to the same punishment as if B had committed theft.\nExplanation 4.—The abetment of an offence being an offence, the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA instigates B to instigate C to murder Z. B accordingly instigates C to murder Z, and C commits that offence in consequence of B's instigation. B is liable to be punished for his offence with the punishment for murder; and, as A instigated B to commit the offence, A is also liable to the same punishment.\nExplanation 5.—It is not necessary to the commission of the offence of abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person who commits it. It is suﬃcient if he engages in the conspiracy in pursuance of which the offence is committed.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA concerts with B a plan for poisoning Z. It is agreed that A shall administer the poison.\nB then explains the plan to C mentioning that a third person is to administer the poison, but without mentioning A's name. C agrees to procure the poison, and procures and delivers it to B for the purpose of its being used in the manner explained. A administers the poison; Z dies in consequence. Here, though A and C have not conspired together, yet C has been engaged in the conspiracy in pursuance of which Z has been murdered. C has therefore committed the offence defined in this section and is liable to the punishment for murder.\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS.—\n\nAbetment under the IPC, 1860 involves active complicity on the part of the abettor at a point of time prior to the actual commission of the offence,59. and it is of the essence of the crime of abetment that the abettor should substantially assist the principal culprit towards the commission of the offence. Nowhere, concurrence in the criminal acts of another without such participation therein as helps to give effect to the criminal act or purpose, is punishable under the Code.\n'Abettor', under this section, means the person who abets (1) the commission of an offence, or (2) the commission of an act, which would be an offence if committed by a person not suffering from any physical or mental incapacity. In the light of the preceding section he must be an instigator or a conspirator or an intentional helper.\nMerely because the accused's brother was carrying on criminal activities in her house, the appellant cannot be held guilty unless there is some material to show her complicity.60.\nExplanation 1.—If a public servant is guilty of an illegal omission of duty made punishable by the Code, and a private person instigates him, then he abets the offence of which such public servant is guilty, though the abettor, being a private person, could not himself have been guilty of that offence.\n\nExplanation 2.—The question regarding abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act abetted and the manner in which abetment was made. Commission of the act abetted is not necessary for the offence of abetment.61. The offence of abetment is complete notwithstanding that the person abetted refuses to do the thing, or fails involuntarily in doing it, or does it and the expected result does not follow. The offence of abetment by instigation depends upon the intention of the person who abets, and not upon the act which is actually done by the person whom he abets.\nExplanation 3.—This explanation makes it clear that the person abetted need not have any guilty intention in committing the act abetted. It applies to abetment generally and there is nothing to indicate that it applies only to abetment by instigation and not to other kinds of abetment.62. The offence of abetment depends upon the intention of the person who abets and not upon the knowledge or intention of the person he employs to act for him.\nExplanation 4.—This Explanation is to be read as follows: \"When the abetment of an offence is an offence the abetment of such an abetment is also an offence\". In view of Explanation 4 appended under section 108 of the IPC, 1860 the contention of accused that there cannot be any abetment of an abetment and it is unknown to criminal jurisprudence, holds no water and merits no consideration.63."

    "section108.1": {
      "title": "Abetment of attempt to commit suicide.—",
      "content": "Section 306 prescribes punishment for abetment of suicide while section 309 punishes attempt to commit suicide. Abetment of attempt to commit suicide is outside the purview of section 306 and it is punishable only under section 309 and read with section 107, IPC, 1860.64."
    },
    "section108.2": {
      "title": "Euthanasia.—",
      "content": "Assisted suicide and assisted attempt to commit suicide are made punishable for cogent reasons in the interest of society. Such a provision is considered desirable to also prevent the danger inherent in the absence of such a penal provision.65. But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,66. the Supreme Court held that passive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict monitoring of the Court. In March 2018, a five-judge Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court gave legal sanction to passive euthanasia, permitting 'living will' by patients.67."
    },
    "section108.3": {
      "title": "Political murder.—",
      "content": "The accused were poor villagers who were brainwashed and became tools for committing crimes. The leaders who called for revenge were not charge sheeted and they got off scot-free. Even their names were not revealed as they were political head- weight. Such leaders who prompt the followers to commit crimes should be charge sheeted for abetment of offence for murder."
    },
    "section108.4": {
      "title": "Abetment is substantive offence.—",
      "content": "The offence of abetment is a substantive one and the conviction of an abettor is, therefore, in no way dependent on the conviction of the principal.68. It cannot be held in\n\nlaw that a person cannot ever be convicted of abetting a certain offence when the person alleged to have committed that offence in consequence of the abetment has been acquitted. The question of the abettor's guilt depends on the nature of the act abetted and the manner in which the abetment was made. Under section 107, IPC, 1860 a person abets the doing of an act in either of three ways which can be: instigating any person to do an act; or engaging with one or more person in any conspiracy for the doing of that act; or intentionally aiding the doing of that act. If a person instigates another or engages with another in a conspiracy for the doing of an act which is an offence, he abets such an offence and would be guilty of abetment under section 115 or section 116, IPC, 1860 even if the offence abetted is not committed in consequence of the abetment. The offence of abetment is complete when the alleged abettor has instigated another or engaged with another in a conspiracy to commit the offence. It is not necessary for the offence of abetment that the act abetted must be committed. This is clear from Explanation 2 and illustration (a) thereto, to section 108, IPC, 1860. It is only in the case of a person abetting an offence by intentionally aiding another to commit that offence that the charge of abetment against him would be expected to fail when the person alleged to have committed the offence is acquitted of that offence.69.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n59.

B accepts the bribe. A has abetted the offence defined in section 161.\n\n(b) A instigates B to give false evidence. B, in consequence of the instigation, commits that offence. A is guilty of abetting that offence, and is liable to the same punishment as B.\n\n(c) A and B conspire to poison Z. A, in pursuance of the conspiracy, procures the poison and delivers it to B in order that he may administer it to Z. B, in pursuance of the conspiracy, administers the poison to Z in A's absence and thereby causes Z's death. Here B is guilty of murder. A is guilty of abetting that offence by conspiracy, and is liable to the punishment for murder.\n\n\n\ncase. It is not necessary in law for the prosecution to prove that the actual operative cause in the mind of the person abetting was instigation and nothing else, so long as there was instigation and the offence has been committed or the offence would have been committed if the person committing the act had the same knowledge and intention as the abettor. The instigation must be with reference to the thing that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person who is instigated. It is only if this condition is fulfilled that a person can be guilty of abetment by instigation. Further, the act abetted should be committed in consequence of the abetment or in pursuance of the conspiracy as provided in the Explanation to section\n109. Under the Explanation an act or offence is said to be committed in pursuance of abetment if it is done in consequence of (a) instigation (b) conspiracy or (c) with the aid constituting abetment. Instigation may be in any form and the extent of the influence which the instigation produced in the mind of the accused would vary and depend upon facts of each case. The offence of conspiracy created under section 120A is bare agreement to commit an offence. It has been made punishable under section 120B. The offence of abetment created under the second clause of section 107 requires that there must be something more than mere conspiracy. There must be some act or illegal omission in pursuance of that conspiracy. That would be evident by section 107 (second), \"engages in any conspiracy … for the doing of that thing, if an act or omission took place in pursuance of that conspiracy\". The punishment for these two categories of crimes is also quite different. Section 109, IPC, 1860 is concerned only with the punishment of abetment for which no express provision has been made in the IPC, 1860. The charge under section 109 should, therefore, be along with charge for murder which is the offence committed in consequence of abetment. An offence of criminal conspiracy is, on the other hand, an independent offence. It is made punishable under section 120B for which a charge under section 109 is unnecessary and inappropriate.77. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such abetment then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the original offence. \"Act abetted\" in section 109 means the specific offence abetted. Therefore, the offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the proved offence.78. The commission of the offence of rape in a hut then in possession of the accused was held to be not sufficient in itself to show that the accused abetted the offence.79."

The offence for the abetment of which a person is charged with the abetment is normally linked with the proved offence.81. A plain reading of sections 107–109 of the IPC, 1860 would show that act complained of in order to amount to abetment has to be committed either prior to or at the time of commission of the offences.82.\n\nWhere the appellant, the wife of a co-accused asked the prosecutrix, aged 15 years to go to the house of the accused and to bring lassi, and when the prosecutrix reached there, the co-accused, who were two in number, bolted the house from inside and committed rape on her, it was held that the appellant was guilty of the offence of abetment. 83."

      "title": "Failure to prevent is not abetment.—",
      "content": "It has been held by the Supreme Court that a failure to prevent the commission of an offence is not an abetment of that offence. The Court said:\nWhere a person aids and abets the perpetrator of a crime at the very time when the crime is committed, he is a principal of the second degree and section 109 applies. But mere failure to prevent the commission of an offence is not by itself an abetment of that offence. Considering the definition in section 109 strictly, the instigation must have reference to the thing that was done and not to the thing that was likely to have been done by the person who is instigated. It is only if this condition is fulfilled that a person can be guilty of abetment by instigation. Section 109 is attracted even if the abettor is not present when the offence abetted is committed provided that he had instigated the commission of the offence or had engaged with one or more other persons in a conspiracy to commit an offence and pursuant to the conspiracy some act or illegal omission takes place or intentionally induced the commission of an offence by an act or illegal omission. In the absence of direct involvement, conviction for abetment is not sustainable. Section 109 provides that if the act abetted is committed in consequence of abetment and there is no provision for the punishment of such abetment then the offender is to be punished with the punishment provided for the original offence. Section 109 applies even where the abettor is not present. Active abetment at the time of committing the offence is covered by section 109.\nThe words 'act abetted' as used in section 109 means the specific offence abetted. Mere help in the preparation for the commission of an offence which is not ultimately committed is not abetment within the meaning of section 109. 'Any offence' in section 109 means offence punishable under IPC or any special or local law. The abetment of an offence under the special or local law, therefore, is punishable under section 109. For constituting offence of abetment, intentional and active participation by the abettor is necessary.84.\n\nWhen a person is charged with the abetment of an offence, it is normally linked with an offence which has been proved.85."

There was obviously thus, not only a legal flaw but also a great prejudice to the appellant in projecting his defence.86.

B, in consequence of the instigation causes grievous hurt to Z. Z dies in consequence. Here, if A knew that the grievous hurt abetted was likely to cause death, A is liable to be punished with the punishment provided for murder.\n\n\n\n\nWhenever any person who if absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor, is present when the act or offence for which he would be punishable in consequence of the abetment is committed, he shall be deemed to have committed such act or offence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS.—\n\nThis section:\n\nis only brought into operation when circumstances amounting to abetment of a particular crime have first been proved, and then the presence of the accused at the commission of that crime is proved in addition … Section 114 deals with the case, where there has been the crime of abetment, but where also there has been actual commission of the crime abetted and the abettor has been present thereat, and the way in which it deals with such a case is this. Instead of the crime being still abetment with circumstances of aggravation, the crime becomes the very crime abetted. The section is evidently not punitory. Because participation de facto. … may sometimes be obscure in detail, it is established by the presumption Juris et de jure that actual presence plus prior abetment can mean nothing else but participation. The presumption raised by s. 114 brings the case within the ambit of s. 34.97.\n\nThe meaning of this section is that if the nature of the act done constitutes abetment, then, if present, the abettor is to be deemed to have committed the offence, though in point of fact another actually committed it. The abetment must be complete apart from the mere presence of the abettor.98. The words \"who if absent would be liable to be punished as an abettor\" clearly show that abetment must be one prior to the commission of the offence and complete by itself.99. Where, for instance, a blow is struck by A, in the presence of, and by the order of, B, both are principals in the transaction. If A instigates B to murder, he commits abetment; if absent, he is punishable as an abettor, and if the offence is committed, then under section 109; if present, he is by this section deemed to have committed the offence and is punishable as a principal. This section applies to cases where a person abets the commission of the offence sometime before at a different place and also remains present at the time the offence is committed.100. But where a person is charged with abetment under this section for aiding in the Commission of an offence, e.g., section 300 IPC, 1860 and the person charged as the principal offender is acquitted on the ground that he had not committed the offence in question, no further question arises regarding abettor's liability.101.\n\nSection 114 is not applicable in every case in which the abettor is present at the commission of the offence abetted. While section 109 is a section dealing generally with abetment, section 114 applies to those cases only in which not only is the abettor present at the time of the commission of the offence but abetment has been committed prior to and independently of his presence.102."

      "title": "Sections 34 and 114.—",
      "content": "The distinction between sections 34 and 114 is a very fine one. According to section 34, where a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of them is liable as if it were done by himself alone; so that if two or more persons are present, aiding and abetting in the commission of a murder each will be tried and convicted as a principal, though it might not be proved which of them actually committed the act. Section 114 refers to the case where a person by abetment, previous to the commission of the act, renders himself liable as an abettor, is present when the act is committed, but takes no active part in the doing of it.103. A mere direction from one person to another and the carrying out of that direction by the other may be only instigation of the latter's act and may not be a case of a joint act falling under section 34.104. Accused provided an axe to his son who assaulted the victim leading to his death. It was not a pre-meditated action on the part of main accused and appellant supplied axe instantaneously without considering its pros and cons. Conviction of appellant on charge of abetment (section 114) is not maintainable.105.\n\n1. 'Present'.—It is not necessary that the party should be actually present, an ear or eye witness of the transaction; he is, in construction of law, present, aiding and abetting, if, with the intention of giving assistance, he be near enough to afford it, should occasion arise. A conspirator, who, while his friends enter into a house and loot it, stands and watches outside in pursuance of the common design, does not escape liability under the section.106.

In other words, if there is no abetment there is no question of the offence under section 306 coming into play. It is inconceivable to have abetment of an abetment. Hence, there cannot be an offence under section 116 read with section 306, IPC, 1860.114. The Supreme Court has never laid down in Satvir Singh115. that under no circumstance an offence under section 306 read with section 511 IPC, 1860 can be committed. The Supreme Court did not have occasion to consider whether a conviction for an offence of attempt to abet the commission of suicide is punishable under section 306 read with section 511, IPC, 1860. Merely because the section opens with the words \"if any person commits suicide\" it cannot be held that in a case of unsuccessful suicide there is no attempt to abet the commission of suicide. Suicide and its attempt on the one hand and abetment of commission of suicide and its attempt on the other are treated differently by law and, therefore, the one who abets the commission of an unsuccessful attempt to commit suicide cannot be held to be punishable merely under section 309 read with section 116, IPC, 1860.

This section deals with former, whatever may be the nature of the offence abetted, while section 115 deals with the latter without having regard to the person or persons abetted.117.\nUnder this section it will be sufficient to show any instigation or other mode of abetment, though neither the effect intended, nor any other effect follows from it. The gravamen of a charge under this section is the abetment itself, the instigation to general lawlessness, not the particular offence of which the commission is instigated.118. The section covers all offences and is a general provision for abetment of any number of persons exceeding ten. When more than ten persons are instigated to commit an offence punishable with death, the offence comes under section 115 as well as this section.119. Abetment of the commission of murder, whether by a single individual or by a class of persons exceeding ten, falls under section 115. In the latter case, it may fall under this section also, but as this section prescribes a lesser punishment, section 115 is the more appropriate provision for such an offence. Although both the sections are applicable, there cannot be separate sentences under the two sections for the same criminal act, and the conviction should properly be under that section which inflicts the higher punishment.120."

A has committed the offence defined in this section.\n\n\n\ndays, the Illustration to section 121 itself makes it clear that \"war\" contemplated by section 121 is not conventional warfare between two nations. Organising or joining an insurrection against the Government of India is also a form of war.9.\nNeither the number of persons nor the manner in which they are assembled or armed is material to constitute an offence under this section. The true criterion is the purpose or intention with which the gathering is assembled. The object of the gathering must be to attain by force and violence an object of a general public nature thereby striking directly against the Government's authority.10.\nIn Md Jamiluddin Nasir v State of WB,11. while enumerating what principles are to be kept in mind in cases, involving application of sections 121, 122, 121A read with section 120B IPC, 1860 as well as section 302 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court, observed inter alia that not all violent behaviour would fall within the prescription of waging war as contemplated under sections 121, 121A, 122 read with section 120B. It was also found that the object sought to be achieved to make a case for the application of section 121, should be directed against the sovereignty of the State and not merely commission of a crime, even if that happens to be of higher magnitude. The concept of 'waging war' should not be stretched too far. A balanced and realistic approach should be maintained while construing the offence committed, to find out whether it amounts to waging of war against the State.\n1. 'Wages war'.—The expression \"waging war\" means and can only mean waging war in the manner usual in war. In other words, in order to support a conviction on such a charge it is not enough to show that the persons charged have contrived to obtain possession of an armoury and have, when called upon to surrender it, used the rifles and ammunition so obtained against the Government troops. It must also be shown that the seizure of the armoury was part and parcel of a planned operation and that their intention in resisting the troops of the Government was to overwhelm and defeat these troops and then to go on and crush any further opposition with which they might meet until either the leaders of the movement succeeded in obtaining the possession of the machinery of Government or those in possession of it yielded to the demands of their leaders.12. An illuminating discussion on the issue of \"Waging war against the Government of India\" is to be found in this Court's decision in State (NCT of Delhi) v Navjot Sandhu @ Afsan Guru.13. In para 272 of the judgment P Venkatarama Reddi, J, speaking for the Court, referred to the report of the Indian Law Commission that examined the draft Penal Code in 1847 and quoted the following passage from the report:\nWe conceive the term 'wages war against the Government' naturally to import a person arraying himself in defiance of the Government in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy would do, and it seems to us, we presume it did to the authors of the Code that any definition of the term so unambiguous would be superfluous.\n\nThe expression, \"in like manner and by like means as a foreign enemy\", is very significant to understand the nature of the violent acts that would amount to waging war. In \"waging war\", the intent of the foreign enemy is not only to disturb public peace or law and order or to kill many people. A foreign enemy strikes at the sovereignty of the State, and his conspiracy and actions are motivated by that animus.14."

      "title": "New concept of \"Waging war\" and Caution against using old authorities.—",
      "content": "The concept of war in section 121 which includes insurrection or a civilian uprising should not be understood in the sense of conventional war between two nations or sovereign entities. The normative phenomenon of war as understood in the\n\ninternational sense does not fit into the ambit and reach of section 121. In the Parliament attack case,15. the Supreme Court held as follows:\nwhile these are the acceptable criteria of waging war, we must dissociate ourselves from the old English and Indian authorities to the extent that they lay down a too general test of attainment of an object of general public nature or a political object. The Supreme Court expressed reservations in adopting this test in its literal sense and construing it in a manner out of tune with the present day. The court must be cautious in adopting an approach which has the effect of bringing within the fold of S.121 all acts of lawless and violent acts resulting in destruction of public properties, etc., and all acts of violent resistance to the armed personnel to achieve certain political objectives. The moment it is found that the object sought to be attained is of a general public nature or has a political hue, the offensive violent acts targeted against the armed forces and public officials should not be branded as acts of waging war. The expression \"waging war\" should not be stretched too far to hold that all the acts of disrupting public order and peace irrespective of their magnitude and repercussions could be reckoned as acts of waging war against the Government. A balanced and realistic approach is called for in construing the expression \"waging war\" irrespective of how it was viewed in the long past. An organised movement attended with violence and attacks against the public officials and armed forces while agitating for the repeal of an unpopular law or for preventing burdensome taxes were viewed as acts of treason in the form of levying war. We doubt whether such construction is in tune with the modern day perspectives and standards."
    },
    "section121.3": {
      "title": "Terrorist Acts.—",
      "content": "Though every terrorist act does not amount to waging war, certain terrorist acts can also constitute the offence of waging war and there is no dichotomy between the two. Terrorist acts can manifest themselves into acts of war. According to the learned Senior Counsel for the State, terrorist acts prompted by an intention to strike at the sovereign authority of the State/Government, tantamount to waging war irrespective of the number involved or the force employed. However, the degree of animus or intent and the magnitude of the acts done or attempted to be done would assume some relevance in order to consider whether the terrorist acts give rise to a state of war. Yet, the demarcating line is by no means clear, much less transparent. It is often a difference in degree. The distinction gets thinner if a comparison is made of terrorist acts with the acts aimed at overawing the Government by means of criminal force. Conspiracy to commit the latter offence is covered by section 121A.16. The incorporation of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, shall not be viewed as deemed repeal of section 121 of the IPC, 1860. As explained in Navjot Sandhu (supra), a \"terrorist act\" and an act of \"waging war against the Government of India\" may have some overlapping features, but a terrorist act may not always be an act of waging war against the Government of India, and vice-versa. The provisions of Chapter IV of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and those of Chapter VI of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), 1860 including section 121, basically cover different areas.17."

      "title": "Foreign nationals not excluded.—",
      "content": "The word \"whoever\" is a word of broad import. Advisedly such language was used departing from the observations made in the context of the Treason Statute. Supreme Court finds no good reason why foreign nationals stealthily entering into Indian territory with a view to subverting the functioning of the Government and destabilising the society should not be held guilty of waging war within the meaning of section 121. The section on its plain term need not be confined only to those who owe allegiance to the established Government.18.\nThe explanation to the section makes it clear that the offence is complete even without any act or illegal omission occurring in pursuance of the conspiracy.19. It is not\n\nnecessary that any act or illegal omission should have taken place in pursuance of a conspiracy. An action of waging war, attempt to wage war or abetment to wage war are also covered by section 121-A.20.\n2. Government of India.—The expression \"Government of India\" is surely not used in the narrow and restricted sense in section 121. In our considered view, the expression \"Government of India\" is used in section 121 to imply the Indian State, the juristic embodiment of the sovereignty of the country that derives its legitimacy from the collective will and consent of its people. The use of the phrase \"Government of India\" to signify the notion of sovereignty is consistent with the principles of Public International Law, wherein sovereignty of a territorial unit is deemed to vest in the people of the territory and exercised by a representative government.21.\n3. 'Abets the waging of such war'.—Such abetment is made a special offence. It is not essential that as a result of the abetment the war should in fact be waged. The main purpose of the instigation should be 'the waging of war'. It should not be merely a remote and incidental purpose but the thing principally aimed at by the instigation. There must be active suggestion or stimulation to the use of violence.22. As criminal acts took place pursuant to the conspiracy, the appellant, as a party to the conspiracy, shall be deemed to have abetted the offence. In fact, he took an active part in a series of steps taken to pursue the objective of conspiracy. The offence of abetting the waging of war, having regard to the extraordinary facts and circumstances of this case, justifies the imposition of capital punishment and, therefore, the judgment of the High Court in regard to the conviction and sentence of Afzal under section 121 IPC, 1860 shall stand.23."

Huge and powerful explosives, sophisticated arms and ammunition carried by the slain terrorists who were to indulge in fidayeen operations with a definite purpose in view, is a clear indicator of the grave danger in store for the inmates of the House. The planned operations if executed, would have spelt disaster for the whole nation. The undoubted objective and determination of the deceased terrorists was to impinge on the sovereign authority of the nation and its Government.

      "content": "Whoever is a member of an unlawful assembly, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine, or with both.\n\n\n\nconstituents or dimensions of an offence under section 149 simpliciter with regard to dictionary meaning of the words 'unlawful assembly' or 'assembly'.2. An assembly of five or more persons having as its common object any of the five objects enumerated under section 1 41 of IPC is deemed to be an unlawful assembly. Membership of an unlawful assembly is itself an offence punishable under section.143, whereas other species of the said offence are dealt with under section 143–145 of IPC. Similarly, sections 146–148 of IPC deals with the offence of rioting which is defined to be use of force or violence by any member thereof. Section 149 makes every member of an unlawful assembly liable for offence that may be committed by any member of the unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for commission of any offence that the members of the assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly.3. To bring a case within section 149 of IPC some essential features must be present. First, there must be an existence of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of section 141 of IPC. This is a mixed question of fact and law.4.\n\nThe underlying principle of section 141 is that law discourages tumultuous assemblage of men to preserve the public peace. Section 141 defines what an 'unlawful assembly' is. Section 142 gives the connotations of 'a member of an unlawful assembly'. Section\n143 punishes tumultuous assemblies as they endanger public peace. It does not require that the purpose of the unlawful assembly should have been fulfilled.\nThe essence of an offence under this section is the combination of five or more persons, united in the purpose of committing a criminal offence, and the consensus of purpose is itself an offence distinct from the criminal offence which these persons agree and intend to commit.5. Unlike the Indian law contained in section 141, IPC, 1860, an unlawful assembly at common law need to have only three or more persons who must assemble together for the common purpose of committing an offence involving use of violence, or for achieving a lawful or unlawful object in such a manner so as to lead to a reasonable apprehension of a breach of peace as a direct result of their conduct.6. Thus, under section 141, IPC, especially under sub-section (3) thereof, use of violence or likelihood of breach of the peace is not at all a sine qua non for an offence of unlawful assembly but this is so under the common law. So under the common law, even if the purpose of the assembly is unlawful, the offence of being an unlawful assembly would not be committed if there is no likelihood of breach of the peace and this would be so even if the unlawful common purpose is carried out."

    "section143.1": {
      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "An 'unlawful assembly' is an assembly of five or more persons if their common object is—\n\n1. to overawe by criminal force\n(a) the Central Government, or\n(b) the State Government, or\n(c) the Legislature, or\n(d) any public servant in the exercise of lawful power;\n2. to resist the execution of law or legal process;\n3. to commit mischief, criminal trespass, or any other offence;\n4. by criminal force—\n(a) to take or obtain possession of any property, or\n\n(b) to deprive any person of any incorporeal right, or\n(c) to enforce any right or supposed right;\n5. by criminal force to compel any person—\n(a) to do what he is not legally bound to do, or\n(b) to omit what he is legally entitled to do.\n\n1. 'Five or more'.— The Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh's case7. held that it is only where five or more persons constituted an assembly that an unlawful assembly is born, provided, of course, the other requirements of the said section as to the common object of the persons composing that assembly are satisfied. In other words, it is an essential condition of an unlawful assembly that its membership must be five or more. The Supreme Court has endorsed the view that the number of injuries caused and the number of persons who were inflicted with those injuries, (in this case, three persons were attacked and they sustained 13, 12 and 7 injuries respectively) can give a clue to the fact that more than three persons must necessarily have participated in the attack.8."
    },
    "section143.2": {
      "title": "Effect of acquittal of some accused:",
      "content": "In Mohan Singh v State of Punjab,9. the Supreme Court considered the question of acquittal of two of the accused charged for the offence under section 302 read with section 149, on the conviction of the remaining three accused. If five or more persons are named in the charge as forming an unlawful assembly and the evidence adduced by the prosecution proves that charge against all of them that is a very clear case where section 149 could be invoked. \"It is however not necessary that five or more persons must be convicted before a charge under section 149 could be successfully brought home to any members of the unlawful assembly. It may be that less than five persons may be charged and convicted under section 302 read with section 149, if the charge is that persons before the court along with others named, constituted an unlawful assembly. Other persons so named may not be available for trial along with their companions for the reason that they have absconded. In such a case, the fact that less than five persons are before the court does not make section 149 inapplicable. Therefore, in order to bring home a charge under section 149, it is not necessary that five or more persons must necessarily be brought before the court and convicted …\" In view of the decision of the Constitution Bench in Mohan Singh's case,10. even after acquittal of the two accused from all the charges levelled against them, if there is any material that they were members of the unlawful assembly, the conviction under section 302 can be based with the aid of section 149.11.\nWhere two of the six accused persons were acquitted without any finding that some other known or unknown persons also were involved in the assault, the remaining four accused persons could not be said to be members of an unlawful assembly.12. Where a group of persons, differently armed, assaulted a man with the common object of killing him and all the assailants accused except one were acquitted, it was held that the remaining sole accused could not be convicted and sentenced under section 302 with the aid of section 149. The court cannot carve out a new case.13. If out of an unlawful assembly consisting of seven named persons four are acquitted, the other three cannot be convicted of rioting as members of an unlawful assembly.14. They may, however, be convicted of the principal offence with the aid of section 34, IPC, 1860.15. Where presence of eight persons in the course of assault was established, four of them were given benefit of doubt but there was no finding anywhere to the effect that only\n\nfour persons had taken part in the assault, conviction of the remaining four on the charge of forming unlawful assembly was not illegal.16.\n2. 'Common object'.— The common object of an unlawful assembly depends firstly on whether such object can be classified as one of those described in section 141; secondly, such common object need not be the product of prior concert but may form on spur of the moment, finally, nature of such common object is a question of fact to be determined by considering the nature of arms, nature of assembly, behaviour of members, etc.17. Mere presence in an assembly does not make a person a member of an unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done something or omitted to do something which would make him a member of the unlawful assembly or unless the case falls under section 142.18. Thus, merely because some persons assembled, all of them cannot be condemned 'ipso facto' as being members of that unlawful assembly.19. At the same time it cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that unless an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of unlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only thing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and was likely to commit any of the acts which fall within the purview of section 141.20. Further the prosecution has to prove that the commission of the offence was by any member of an unlawful assembly and such offence must have been committed in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly or such that the members of the assembly knew that it was likely to be committed.21. The word 'object' means the purpose or design and, in order to make it 'common', it must be shared by all. In other words, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by no means necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly and the other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not continue to be the same. It may be modified or altered or abandoned at any stage.22.\nSection 142 postulates that whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful one, intentionally joins the same would be a member thereof. Whether an assembly is unlawful one or not, would depend on various factors, the principal amongst them being a common object formed by the members thereof to commit an offence specified in one or the other clauses contained in section 141.23. In a free fight between two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to several others on both the sides, it was held that the formation of an unlawful assembly was not impossible but the common object of such an assembly cannot be determined on the basis of serious injury by one of them.24. The accused along with about six–eight others forcibly entered into the office of a union leader and assaulted him but the victim did not receive any serious injury inside the union office and managed to escape. Later on in the open space some members of the crowd surrounded and attacked him and dealt fatal blows. It was held that the accused who entered the union office did not share the common object of committing murder of the deceased. They were convicted under sections 326/149.25. Where the accused forming an unlawful assembly assaulted the deceased but the injury caused by only one accused proved to be fatal and the injuries caused by the others were found to be simple, it was held that the common object of the unlawful assembly was only to cause grievous hurt and only the accused who caused fatal injury was liable to be convicted for murder and others under section 326/149.26.\n\nThe Supreme Court observed on the facts of a case that given the circumstances in which the assembly came together and given that all parties were aware that among them, certain members carried weapons like guns and spear, even if it was held that common object of assembly was not to cause death, it would not be an unreasonable inference that all accused knew that the offence of culpable homicide was likely to be\n\ncommitted in prosecution of such an armed assault on another group which was not prepared to withstand such an attack, bringing about application of second portion of section 149. Therefore, it was held, that any of the accused found to have participated in the assault should be held guilty under section 141 and 149.27."

It is difficult indeed, though not impossible, to collect direct evidence of such knowledge. An inference may be drawn from circumstances such as the background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour of the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime.29."

Where a number of persons resisted an attempt to search a house which was being made by officers, who had not the written order investing them with the power to do so, it was held that the persons resisting the attempted search were not guilty of this offence.32.

In Manga @ Man Singh v State of Uttarakhand, the Supreme Court while considering the application of principle of 'ejusdem generis' to section 141 'third' clause, observed that:\nWe fail to appreciate as to how simply because the offences mischief or criminal trespass are used preceding the expression \"other offence\" in Section 141 'third', it should be taken that such offence would only relate to a minor offence of mischief or trespass and that the expression \"other offence\" should be restricted only to that extent. As pointed out by us above, the offence of mischief and trespass could also be as grave as that of an offence of murder, for which the punishment of life imprisonment can be imposed as provided for under Sections 438, 449, 450 etc. Therefore, we straight away hold that the argument of learned senior counsel for the Appellants to import the principle of 'ejusdem generis' to Section 141 'third', cannot be accepted.34."

Government imposed curfew and the Special Operation Squad (SOS) was called to control the communal riots on information of stone pelting, throwing of glass bottles, acid bulbs and firing from the terrace of Suleman Bakery. It was argued that at any rate SOS was an unlawful assembly on account of the third clause of section 141 of IPC, 1860, and hence, all the discharged accused persons were members of the unlawful assembly and had to be at least charged and inquired into by the courts below. It was argued that the assembly of the police at least till the time they broke open the door was a lawful move, as it was their duty but they should not have broken open the door and trespassed the Suleman bakery; and all those who entered Suleman bakery formulated an unlawful assembly as they illegally trespassed into the Suleman bakery. Since A-1, Shri Tyagi, had ordered them to break open the doors and he was a part of that unlawful assembly who had the common object. The Supreme Court held that they were all the members of the SOS and had the duty to quell the riots. They were not doing anything illegal in coming out and trying to control the riots. Court rejected the argument by holding that a trespass becomes a criminal trespass if it is with an intention to annoy or to do something illegal which is not the case here. There was no question of the so- called entry amounting to criminal trespass.35."

This clause does not take away the right of private defence of property. It does not affect clause 2 of section 105, which allows a person to recover the property carried away by theft. It is meant to prevent the resort to force in vindication of supposed rights. It makes a distinction between an admitted claim or an ascertained right and a disputed claim.36.\nWhere five or more persons assemble for maintaining by force or show of force a right which they bona fide believe they possess, and not for enforcing by such force or show of force a right or supposed right of theirs, they do not constitute an unlawful assembly.37. An assembly of five or more persons cannot be designated as an unlawful assembly under this section if its object is to defend property by the use of force within the limits prescribed by law.38. But when a body of men are determined to vindicate their rights, or supposed rights, by unlawful force, and when they engage in a fight with men who, on the other hand, are equally determined to vindicate, by unlawful force, their rights or supposed rights, no question of self-defence arises. Neither side is trying to protect itself, but each side is trying to get the better of the other.39."

      "title": "Being member of unlawful assembly.—",
      "content": "Section 142 shows that it is sufficient for the offence of riot to be proved against an individual that the individual should remain in an unlawful assembly as soon as he is aware that the assembly is unlawful. The word \"continues\" in the section means physical presence as a member of the unlawful assembly, that is, to be physically present in the crowd.44. This, however, should not be interpreted to mean that mere presence as a curious onlooker or bystander at the scene of the unlawful assembly without sharing its common object would make a person liable under section 142, IPC, 1860, for being a member of an unlawful assembly.45. Thus common object cannot be attributed to a person from his mere presence at the scene of the occurrence. There must be some other direct or circumstantial evidence to justify that inference.46.\n\nFor being a member of unlawful assembly it is not necessary that a person must commit some overt act towards the commission of the crime. The test is whether he knows of its common object and continues to keep its company due to his own free will.47. Thus, where a large procession of Kannadigas, taken out to voice protest against Maharashtrians, turned violent, started pelting stones and attacking police officers; the procession turned into an unlawful assembly the moment it developed the common object of causing damage to property and injuries to police officers. Thereafter, every person who continued as a member of the assembly became liable for the offence committed by the processionalists by virtue of section 149 of IPC, 1860.48. If some unidentified members of an unlawful assembly behaved in an unruly manner, the other members in the procession cannot be held guilty of the offence by foisting vicarious liability, merely because they were in the procession.49."

Where the accused, who were in possession of the disputed land, went upon it in a large body armed with sticks, prepared in anticipation of a fight, and were reaping the paddy grown by them, when the complainant's party came up and attempted to cut the same, whereupon a fight ensued and one man was seriously wounded and died subsequently, it was held that the common object was not to enforce a right but to maintain undisturbed the actual enjoyment of a right and that the assembly was not therefore unlawful.51.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.

For a successful prosecution of a riot case the prosecution must prove:—\n\n(i) that there were five or more persons;\n(ii) that they had a common purpose;\n(iii) that they had begun to execute such purpose;\n(iv) that they intended to help one another by force, if necessary;\n(v) that they had shown such degree of violence which would alarm at least one person of reasonable courage.\nThis last mentioned fact need not be proved by calling a person, who has been so alarmed but it may be made out from facts and circumstances of the case in hand.55. The ingredients mentioned in item numbers (iv) and (v) above are not to be found at all in section 146 of IPC, 1860. Where some youths exceeding three were found demolishing a wall but disappeared the moment the caretaker of the building appeared at the scene, it was held that they could not be convicted of the offence of riot under the common law as there was no evidence of show of violence sufficient to alarm one person of reasonable firmness and courage.56. In the Indian context in this very case the offence of rioting was complete the moment the youths used force to demolish the wall for it was not necessary in the Indian law to use force or violence against a person, far less to cause alarm to a person of reasonable courage and firmness. Force or violence against an inanimate object too comes within the purview of section 146, IPC, 1860.57."

      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "The following are the essentials of the offence of rioting:—\n\n(1) That the accused persons, being five or more in number, formed an unlawful assembly.\n(2) That they were animated by a common object.\n(3) That force or violence was used by the unlawful assembly or any member of it in prosecution of the common object.\n1. 'Force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly'.—The word 'violence' is not restricted to force used against persons only, but extends also to force against inanimate objects.58. The words 'force' and 'violence' in this section connote different and distinct concepts. 'Force' is narrowed down by the definition under section 350 to persons while the word 'violence' includes violence to property and other inanimate objects.59.\nThe use of any force, even though it be of the slightest possible character, by any one of an assembly once established as unlawful, constitutes rioting.60. Where a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of the assembly throws down a man and then causes him bodily hurt, the offence of rioting under this section is complete as soon as the man is thrown down by using force and the hurt subsequently caused would come under section 323 or section 325.61. The essential question in a case under section 147 is whether there was an unlawful assembly of five or more persons. The identity of the persons comprising the assembly is a matter relating to the determination of the guilt of the individual accused and even when it is possible to convict less than five persons only, section 147 still applies, if upon the\n\nevidence in the case the Court is able to hold that the person or persons who have been found guilty were members of an assembly of five or more persons, known or unknown, identified or unidentified.62. It has been held by the Supreme Court that this section is not attracted where the act in question was done in pursuit of a lawful object. In this case the investigating police party was being led by the witness to a spot for recovering the dead-body. The witness tried to run away and was beaten up with a lathi. He died shortly thereafter. The Supreme Court did not sustain the conviction of the police personnel under this section.63.\n\n2. 'In prosecution of the common object'.—Acts done by some members of an unlawful assembly outside the common object of the assembly or of such a nature as the members of the assembly could not have known to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object are only chargeable against the actual perpetrators of those acts.64. It is obligatory on the part of the court to examine that if the offence committed is not in direct prosecution of the common object, it yet may fall under second part of section 149, IPC, 1860, if the offence was such as the members knew was likely to be committed. Further inference has to be drawn as what was the number of persons; how many of them were merely passive witnesses; what were their arms and weapons. Number and nature of injuries is also relevant to be considered.65."

      "content": "(1) Notwithstanding the large number of rioters or of the persons put up in Court for rioting, and the consequent difficulty for the prosecution to name the specific acts attributed to each of the accused, the Court must see to it that all the ingredients required for unlawful assembly and rioting are strictly proved by the prosecution before convicting the particular accused persons.68.(2) Spectators, wayfarers, etc., attracted to the scene of the rioting by curiosity, should not be, by reason of their mere presence at the scene of rioting and with the rioters, held to be members of the unlawful assembly or rioters. But of course, if they are proved to have marched with the rioters for a long distance, when the rioters were shouting tell-tale slogans and pelting stones, it will be for them to prove their innocence under section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. (3) It will be very unsafe, in the case of such a large mob of rioters, to rely on the evidence of a single witness speaking to the presence of an accused in that mob for convicting him, especially when no overt act of violence, or shouting of slogan, or organising the mob, or giving orders to it or marching in procession with it, or other similar thing is proved against him. In a big riot by hundreds of persons, it is very easy even to mistake one person for another, and to implicate honestly really innocent\n\npersons, and even, to mistake persons seen elsewhere as having been seen there. An ordinary rule of caution and prudence will require that an accused person identified only by one witness, and not proved to have done any overt act, etc., as described above, should be acquitted, by giving him the benefit of the doubt. (4) Where there are acute factions based on either agrarian disputes and troubles or on political wrangling and rivalry or on caste divisions or on divisions of the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots,\" the greatest care must be exercised before believing the evidence of a particular witness belonging to one of these factions against an accused of the opposite view. This principle becomes of special importance when there are no overt acts, etc., proved, and when there are only one or two witnesses speaking to the presence of the accused among the rioters, and they belong to the classes or factions opposed to the accused.\n(5) Mere followers in rioting deserve a much more lenient sentence than leaders, who mislead them into such violent acts, by emotional appeals, slogans and cries.69."

      "title": "Every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object.",
      "content": "If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object1 of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that offence.\n\n\n\nan unlawful assembly for acts done in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for such offences as the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object.82. However, Benches of a smaller strength in some cases83. have observed that section 149 creates a specific and distinct offence. Thus the law declared therein by the Benches of a smaller strength cannot be taken as correct legal position.84. This section creates a specific and distinct offence.85. It is not the intention of the legislature in enacting section 149 to render every member of unlawful assembly liable to punishment for every offence committed by one or more of its members. In order to attract section 149, it must be shown that the incriminating act was done to accomplish the common object of unlawful assembly and it must be within the knowledge of other members as one likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object.86. A plain reading of the section shows that the provision is in two parts. The first part deals with cases in which an offence is committed by any member of the assembly \"in prosecution of the common object\" of that assembly. The second part deals with cases where the commission of a given offence is not by itself the common object of the unlawful assembly but members of such assembly 'knew that the same is likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the assembly'.87. This section makes both the categories of persons, those who have committed the offence as also those who were members of the same assembly liable for the offences under section 149, IPC, 1860, provided the other requirements of the section are satisfied. That is to say, if an offence is committed by any person of an unlawful assembly, which the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed, every member of such an assembly is guilty of the offence. The law is clear that membership of unlawful assembly is sufficient to hold such participating members vicariously liable. For mulcting liability on the members of an unlawful assembly under section 149, it is not necessary that every member of the unlawful assembly should commit the offence in prosecution of the common object of the assembly. Mere knowledge of the likelihood of commission of such an offence by the members of the assembly is sufficient.88. Whenever the court convicts any person or persons of any offence with the aid of section 149, a clear finding regarding the common object of the assembly must be given and the evidence disclosed must show not only the nature of the common object but also that the object was unlawful. If members of the assembly knew or were aware of the likelihood of a particular offence being committed in prosecution of a common object, they would be liable for the same under section 149.89. In the absence of such finding as also any overt act on the part of the accused persons, mere fact that they were armed would not be sufficient to prove common object.90. Where the moot question as to common objective is proved all the members of unlawful assembly would be vicariously liable for the acts done by the said assembly and thus the separate roles played by all the accused persons need not be examined.91. Section 149 makes it abundantly clear that if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence is a member of such an assembly, is guilty of that offence, however if a person is a mere bystander, and no specific role is attributed to him, he may not come under the wide sweep contemplated under section 149.92. Further where the member had no knowledge of the unlawful object of the assembly or after having gained knowledge, he attempted to prevent the assembly from accomplishing the unlawful object, and after having failed to do so, he disassociated himself from the assembly, the mere participation of him in such an assembly would not be made him liable.93.\n\nThe section constitutes a substantive offence.94.\n\nThe Supreme Court reiterated the ambit and scope of this principle of liability as follows:\nSection 149 IPC provides for vicarious liability. If an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of a common object thereof or such as the members of that assembly knew that the offence was likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who at the time of committing that offence was member would be guilty of the offence committed. The common object may be commission of one offence while there may be likelihood of commission of yet another offence, the knowledge whereof is capable of being safely attributable to the members of the unlawful assembly. Whether a member of such unlawful assembly was aware as regards likelihood of commission of another offence or not would depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. Background of the incident, the motive, the nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms carried by the members of the assembly, their common object and the behaviour of the members soon before, at or after the actual commission of the crime would be relevant factors for drawing an inference in that behalf.\"95. \"Common object\" means the purpose or design shared by all the members which may be formed at any stage. It has to be ascertained from the acts and conduct of the individuals concerned and surrounding circumstances.96. Common object to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis that the weapons carried by the accused were dangerous.97."

If these three elements are satisfied, then only a conviction under section 149, IPC, 1860, may be substantiated, and not otherwise.98.

As a consequence, the effect of section 149 of IPC, 1860, may be different on different members of the same unlawful assembly. Decisions of the Supreme Court in Gangadhar Behera v State of Orissa and Bishnaalias BhiswadebMahato v State of WB,101. similarly explained and reiterated the legal position on the subject."

      "content": "There is a difference between object and intention, for though their object is common, the intention of the several members may differ and indeed may be similar only in respect that they are all unlawful, while the element of participation in action, which is the leading feature of section 34, is replaced in section 149 by membership of the\n\nassembly at the time of the committing of the offence. Both sections deal with combinations of persons, who become punishable as sharers in an offence. Thus they have a certain resemblance and may to some extent overlap, but section 149 cannot at any rate relegate section 34 to the position of dealing only with joint action by the commission of identically similar criminal acts, a kind of case which is not in itself deserving of separate treatment at all\".102. Section 34 of IPC, 1860 refers to cases in which several persons both do an act and intend to do that act: it does not refer to cases where several persons intend to do an act and some one or more of them do an entirely different act. In the latter class of cases section 149 of the Code may be applicable but section 34 is not.103. On the other hand, if five or more persons both do an act and intend to do it, both section 34 and section 149, may apply, since the term \"member\" in the singular includes the plural also (section 9). In this connection see detailed discussion and cases under sub-head \"Distinction between section 34 and section 149, IPC, 1860,\" under section 34 ante."
    },
    "section149.4": {
      "title": "Scope.—",
      "content": "This section is not intended to subject a member of an unlawful assembly to punishment for every offence which is committed by one of its members during the time they are engaged in the prosecution of the common object. It is divided into two parts: (1) an offence committed by a member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly; and (2) an offence such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly, is one which the accused knew would be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object.104. The section applies equally in cases where offences are committed by single member of the assembly and in cases where offences are committed by two or more members of the assembly acting in furtherance of a common intention.105.\n\nOnce the Court can find that an offence has been committed by some member or members of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object, then whether the principal offender has been convicted for that offence or not, upon the plain wording of this section, the other members may be constructively convicted of that offence, provided they are found to have had the necessary intention or knowledge. It is not correct to say that when a member of an unlawful assembly is to be found constructively guilty of an offence under this section, it must be the same offence of which the principal is convicted and not some other offence.106.\nMembers of an unlawful assembly may have a community of object only up to a certain point, beyond which they may differ in their objects, and the knowledge possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object will vary, not only according to the information at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this the effect of this section may be different on different members of the same unlawful assembly.107.\nBefore this section can be called in aid, the Court must find with 'certainty' that there were at least five persons sharing the common object. A finding that three of them 'may or may not have been there' betrays uncertainty on this vital point and it consequently becomes impossible to allow the conviction to rest on this uncertain foundation. This is not to say that five persons must always be convicted before this section can be applied. It is possible in some cases for Judges to conclude that though five were unquestionably there the identity of one or more is in doubt. In that case, the conviction of the rest with the aid of this section would be good.108. Non-applicability\n\nof section 149, IPC, 1860, is no bar in convicting the accused persons under section 302, IPC read with section 34 of IPC, if the evidence discloses commission of offence in furtherance of common intention of them all. It would depend on the facts of each case as to whether section 34 or section 149 of IPC or both the provisions are attracted.109. Where the accused, forming an unlawful assembly, chased and killed a man by inflicting multiple injuries on his body with sharp edged weapons, it was held that circumstances and transaction taken as a whole were sufficient to invoke section 34 or section 149.110.\n\nNo judgment can be cited as a precedent however similar the facts may be. Each case must rest on its own facts.111.\nThe persons acting in self-defence of property cannot be members of an unlawful assembly.112.\n1. 'In prosecution of the common object'.—The expression \"in prosecution of common object\" has to be strictly construed as equivalent to \"in order to attain the common object\". There must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a particular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may have community of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ in their objects and the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this the effect of section 149, IPC, 1860, may be different on different members of the same assembly.113. The word \"knew\" as used in the second branch of section 149 implied something more than \"possibility\" and it cannot bear the sense of \"might have known\". An offence committed in prosecution of common object would generally be the offence which the members of the assembly knew was likely to be committed.114. This phrase means that the offence committed was immediately connected with the common object of the unlawful assembly, of which the accused were members. The act must be one which must have been done with a view to accomplish the common object attributed to the members of the unlawful assembly. Where the common object is established, the unlawful assembly does not cease to be so by merely splitting itself into two groups for launching the attack. Section 149, IPC, 1860, would be clearly applicable to such a case.115.\nThe words \"in prosecution of the common object\" do not mean \"during the prosecution of the common object of the assembly\". It means that the offence committed was immediately connected with the common object of the assembly or the act is one which upon the evidence appears to have been done with a view to accomplish the common object attributed to the members of the assembly. The words \"in prosecution of the common object\" have to be strictly construed as equivalent to \"in order to attain common object\".116. In the present case,117. the common object of unlawful assembly was to kill a particular person. Two members of the assembly went after him. Sensing danger, he ran into the adjoining room to fetch a spear to defend himself. His wife blocked his way and he could not come out. Frustrated, as they were, the two members of the assembly gunned down two young girls of their intended victim who were then playing in the courtyard outside the house. The conviction of the rest of the members for this murder was set aside as this was neither their common object, nor incidental to that, nor necessary for its attainment.\nVicarious responsibility can be fastened only on proof that the ultimate act was done in pursuance of common object.118.\nEven where the common object is not developed at the initial stage, it may develop on the spot, eoinstanti. Thus, where it appeared that members of a party divided\n\nthemselves into small groups and waited for the victim and simultaneously pounced upon him and jointly removed his body, the fact that they did not assemble at one place under any plan, but came there separately, was considered by the Supreme Court to be not of much importance because at the sensitive moment they seemed to be acting in an organised way.119. Where, however, the agreement specifically was only to give a thrashing to the victim, but one of them pulled out a knife and stabbed the victim, it was held that neither at the initial stage nor at the execution stage, could it be said that there was the object to cause a fatal injury so as to make all others liable for the death.120."

      "content": "While membership of an unlawful assembly itself is an offence under section 143, IPC, 1860, use of force by members of the unlawful assembly gives rise to the offence of rioting which is punishable either under section 147 or section 148, IPC. Membership of the 4 accused in the unlawful assembly and use of force with dangerous weapons is borne out by the evidence on record. The said facts would make the acquitted accused liable for the offence under section 148 of IPC, 1860.122. Where a small compact body of men armed with clubs, and headed by a man carrying a gun, endeavoured to take forcible possession of certain lands, and one of the opponents was shot by their leader, it was held that they were guilty of murder.123.\n\nWhere in a faction- ridden village the members of one party seeing someone of the other party alighting from a bus emerged together to attack him, it could be easily said that they shared the common object to assault one of their enemies and at that stage the assembly turned into an unlawful assembly.124. Where several persons assaulted and caused injuries to the deceased, however except one incised injury on the head, all were lacerated injuries on legs, common object of the unlawful assembly was held to cause grievous hurt and not murder and conviction of the accused was altered from sections 302/ 149 to sections 326/149.125. Where the accused, being members of an unlawful assembly and being armed with sharp edged weapons, used only the blunt sides of their weapons, they were held to share the common object of causing grievous hurt and not murder.57 Accused persons variously armed entered a police wireless station after breaking open doors and windows and assaulted inmates. Their individual acts were not known. It was held that all the accused persons must be deemed to have shared the common object of lurking house trespass and could be convicted under sections 149/455.126. Where two innocent young girls were killed in a very gruesome manner just only to teach a lesson to their mother over a property dispute, every member of the killing team was held to be equally guilty deserving the maximum penalty of death, it being a case of the \"rarest of rare\" category.127. Where the death of a police officer was caused while he was arresting the accused and those who caught hold of him intended only to prevent him from performing his duty, but the main accused suddenly killed him, it was held that the common object of the unlawful assembly was to deter police from performing their duty and not to commit murder. Their conviction was altered from one under sections 302/149 to one under section\n\n353/149.128. Several persons entered into a conspiracy to commit dacoity during the course of which one of the accused fired a shot which missed the target and hit one of his accomplices who died. The other accused fired a shot and killed one of the inmates of the house. The accused killing the inmate was convicted under sections 302 and\n398. The three others were punished under section 398/149, their common object being dacoity and not murder.129.\nThe accused persons were armed with lathis and guns. They declared on entry into the threshing floor mill that they had come to take away the paddy and, if the owner resisted, they would take life out of him. In these circumstances they caused death. s conviction under section 300 read with section 149 was held to be not illegal.130.\nThere is no requirement for conviction under the section of assigning definite roles to the accused persons.131."

Where the accused persons were acting in the exercise of the right of private defence, the Supreme Court said that they could not be said to have constituted an unlawful assembly. Only one of them caused an injury after the right of private defence had ceased to be available to them. They could not be convicted under section 148 with the aid of section 149.133."

The fact that the accused was present at the place of occurrence as a part of the unlawful assembly was not disputed. That was held to be sufficient to hold him guilty even if no overt act was attributed to him.134. This principle may not apply where the presence is such that merely by its reason the person concerned does not become a member of the assembly. This happened in a case in which the names of only 4 persons were mentioned in the complaint. Five other persons were not mentioned because they kept standing at the back without any participation in the incident. But they were also roped in under section 149. The Supreme Court held that they could not be regarded as members of the assembly. Their conviction was impermissible.135. Once a membership of an unlawful assembly is established it is not incumbent on the prosecution to establish whether any specific overt act has been assigned to any accused. Mere membership of the unlawful assembly is sufficient and every member is vicariously liable for the acts done by others either in the prosecution of the common\n\nobject of the unlawful assembly or such as the members of the unlawful assembly knew were likely to be committed.136."

Common object to commit a murder cannot be inferred only on the basis that the weapons carried by the accused were dangerous.138. The common object of assembly is normally to be gathered from the circumstances of each case such as the time and place of the gathering of the assembly, the conduct of the gathering as distinguished from the conduct of the individual members are indicative of the common object of the gathering.

After his retirement a member of the second faction was killed. It was held that the wounded man had ceased to be a member of the unlawful assembly when he retired wounded, and that he could not, under this section, be made liable for the subsequent murder.141. Where the accused persons rushed to the house of K with a view to injure K or inmates of his house but one of the accused attacked M, a woman working in the house causing grievous injuries to her, the other accused persons could not be held vicariously liable with the help of section 149, IPC, 1860, as it was not their common object nor had they any animus against M.142. An unlawful assembly of 50 persons was alleged to have caused two deaths. There were no specific allegations against some of them, or that any criminal act was done by them in furtherance of common intention. It was held that they could not be convicted with the aid of either section 34 or section 149.143. When an accused leaves the place of occurrence and thus ceases to be a member of the unlawful assembly, he cannot be convicted vicariously with the aid of section 149, IPC, for the murder which is committed subsequent to his leaving the scene of crime.144. Where one member fired\n\non being supplied with a bullet by another only the member supplying the bullet was held liable under section 302/149 and others were convicted only under section 325/194, IPC.145. After a heated exchange of words, the accused went home and came back with a gun accompanied by others who also armed and immediately opened fire at the victim causing his death. Others did not fire at the victim. They fired indiscriminately at others injuring some people. Things happened in a very short span of time. It was held that the others could not have formed an unlawful assembly with the main accused with a common object. The main culprit alone was convicted of murder.146. Where people collected outside a police-station to voice their protest over police- inaction in connection with the murder of a child, such an assembly could not possibly have any common object to commit criminal trespass, arson, looting, etc., and as such none could be convicted with the aid of section 149, IPC, 1860.147. All the accused, armed only with lathis, caused multiple injuries to a man who died. All the injuries caused were simple in nature and were on non-vital parts of the body of the deceased, it could not be said that their common object was to kill the deceased. They were held liable to be convicted under section 304, Part II/149 and not under section 302/149.148.\n\nWhere the common object of an unlawful assembly was to cause hurt to prosecution witnesses, and the daughter of a witness who came out from inside the house only to save her father sustained an injury at the hands of one of the accused and died, it was held that there could be no common object in the circumstances to commit murder. They were held to be guilty under section 323 read with section 149.149."

      "content": "The Supreme Court in Nanak Chand v State of Punjab,152. considered the question whether there could be a conviction for the offence under section 302 simpliciter, when the charge was for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC. It was held that when there is no separate charge for the offence under section 302 simpliciter and charge is only for the offence under section 302 read with 149, the conviction for the offence under section 302 simpliciter is not sustainable. In Suraj Pal v State of UP,153. 19 accused were tried for the offences under sections 148, 307 and 302 read with section 149 of IPC. Sessions Court convicted all the accused. In appeal to the High Court, ten accused were acquitted. Conviction and sentence of one accused was affirmed for the offence under sections 148, 307 and 302. Holding that absence of specific charges against the appellant under sections 307 and section 302, IPC in respect of which he was sentenced is a very serious lacuna as framing of a specific and distinct charge in respect of every distinct head of criminal liability constituting an offence is the foundation for a conviction and sentence. The question was referred to\n\nthe Five Judge Constitution Bench, to determine whether there was a conflict of view between Nanak Chand's case (supra) and Suraj Pal's case (supra) and if so to determine it in Willie Slaney v State of Madhya Pradesh.154. The Constitution Bench held that there was no conflict of views in the two decisions. It was held that the observations in Nanak Chand (supra), have to be appreciated on close examination of facts. Their Lordships considered the effect of a charge for constructive liability and its difference with a charge for the offence simpliciter and held that there was no prejudice and that the conviction is not invalid because of the nature of the charge. A three Judge Bench in Subran v State,155. held that when the charge is under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC, without a specific charge having been framed for the offence under section 302 of IPC, as envisaged in law, an accused cannot be convicted for the substantive offence under section 302 of IPC, their Lordships did not consider the Constitution Bench decision in Willie Slaney's case (supra). Later in the review judgment, Subran v State, 1993 (3) SCC 722 , their lordships reviewed the same as follows:\nOn a review of the judgment, we find that the opinion expressed is capable of being misinterpreted. The opinion expressed therein was required to be confined to the peculiar facts of the case, but it tends to give an impression as if it is a general exposition of law, which it was not meant to be.\n\nThe legal position in the light of the Constitution Bench decision in Willie Slaney156. is clear. If the charge framed discloses the overt act committed by a particular accused, though the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC, 1860, and the accused faced trial with the knowledge that the prosecution case is that he committed the particular overt act which caused the death, non-framing of a distinct charge for the offence under section 302 will not cause prejudice to the accused, even though the charge framed was under section 302 read with section 149, IPC. In such a case, even though the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with section 149 of IPC and there is not even an alternate charge for the offence under section 302 simpliciter, when the charge discloses the overt act by a particular accused which caused the death of the victim, if the evidence establishes that, that particular accused inflicted that particular injury which caused the death, he could definitely be convicted for the offence under section 302 simpliciter. Even though there is no specific charge for section 302 simpliciter and the charge is for the offence under section 302 read with 149 of IPC, there could be a conviction under section 302 simpliciter."

It deals with the case of those who are neither abettors of nor participators in the offence committed by an unlawful assembly.\nThe section creates a specific offence. It intends to embrace all those who hire, promote or connive at the employment of persons and render them punishable as principal participators. Under the section, a person, though not actually a member of an unlawful assembly himself, may be held guilty of being a member of the assembly and may be held liable for the offence which may be committed by the assembly to the same extent as if he had himself committed that offence. But this is possible only when it is found that he hired or engaged or employed or promoted or connived at the hiring, engagement or employment by any other person to join or become a member of the assembly. There must have been an unlawful assembly which was composed of persons so hired, etc., and an offence committed in the course of that assembly for which he becomes equally liable. The word \"promotes\" denotes acceleration or inducement. Though the word \"employ\" or \"employment\" is used, it does not mean recruitment.

In this section the assembly need not be an 'unlawful assembly' but if it is likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace, then joining or continuing in such assembly after it has been commanded to disperse is punishable. Section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code confers on a Magistrate and an officer in charge of a police-station the power to disperse an unlawful assembly or any assembly of five or more persons likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace. A bare reading of section 129, Cr PC, 1973, would make it abundantly clear that a lawful procession or assembly cannot be regarded as likely to cause a breach of the peace when it is admitted that not they but some other body of persons is bent on attacking them. Whether an assembly is likely to cause a disturbance of public peace has to be judged from its own acts and behaviour and not from the behaviour of another hostile group whose physical opposition may cause a breach of the peace.164. \"Thus, if an assembly other than an unlawful assembly behaves in such a manner as to provoke a breach of the peace by its own conduct or action, there would be a justification to order it to disperse under the powers given by section 129 of the Criminal Procedure Code. But if a religious assembly or procession remains peaceful in the enjoyment of its legitimate rights and privileges under the law, it should not be ordered to disperse merely because a body of antagonistic persons take it into their heads to attack it with a view to provoke a riot. In such a case, it is rather that body of aggressive persons that constitutes an unlawful assembly and requires to be sternly dealt with under the law\".165. So where a peaceful group of persons who were cutting crop on their own land refused to disperse on being commanded to do so by an Inspector of Police merely because another hostile group objected to the harvesting of the crop, it was held that as these persons were not commanded lawfully to disperse under section 129, Cr PC, 1973, they could not be convicted under section 151, IPC, 1860.166. In order to bring a case within the mischief of this section there must be clear evidence to show that the assembly had been \"lawfully commanded\" to disperse. Thus where the police officers in their evidence said that they had merely warned the two warring factions, it could not be said that the assembly had been commanded to disperse and as such there was no question of invoking section 151, IPC, to prosecute the members of the assembly.167.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n164.

Sub-section (1)(c) has been newly inserted by Act 31 of 1972. This section provides for enhanced punishment for offences committed in a place of worship and making offences under this section cognisable. Under this section promoting enmity between different groups on grounds such as, place of birth, or residence are included and it also makes promotion of disharmony or feelings of ill-will an offence punishable under it. The provision in clause\n(b) of sub-section (1) to the section includes acts prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different regional groups and sub-section (2) provides for enhanced punishment for any offence specified in sub-section (1) when it is committed in a place of worship, etc. With communal and fissiparous tendencies on the increase this section has now gained an added importance. The object of section 153-A is to prevent breaches of the public tranquillity which might result from excited feelings of enmity between classes of people. Absence of malicious intention is a relevant factor to judge whether the offence is committed.180.\nSection 153A of IPC, 1860, covers a case where a person by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representations or otherwise, promotes or attempts to promote, disharmony or feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities or acts prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony or is likely to disturb the public tranquillity. The gist of the offence is the intention to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of people. The intention to cause disorder or incite the people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under section 153A of IPC and the prosecution has to prove prima facie the existence of mens rea on the part of the accused.181. The intention to cause disorder or incite people to violence is the sine qua non of the offence under section 153A IPC and the prosecution has to prove the existence of mens rea in order\n\nto succeed. In this case, the prosecution has not been able to establish any mens rea on the part of the appellants as envisaged by the provisions of section 153A IPC, by their raising casually the slogans a couple of times. The offence under section 153A IPC is, therefore, not made out.182.\nThere must either be the intention to promote such feelings, or such feelings should be promoted as the result of words spoken or written. The words promotes or tends to promote feelings of enmity are to be read as connoting a successful or unsuccessful attempt to promote feelings of enmity. It must be the purpose or parts of the purpose of the accused to promote such feelings, and, if it is no part of his purpose, the mere circumstance that there may be a tendency is not sufficient.183. The word classes includes any definite and ascertainable class of people. Capitalists do not constitute a class within the meaning of this section.184. To bring any body of persons within the description of a class of people, the body of persons must possess a certain degree of importance numerically, and must be ascertained with certainty and distinguished from any other class. Every group of persons cannot be designated as a class.185. The classes contemplated must be not merely clearly defined and separable but also numerous. A small and limited group of Zamindars cannot be regarded as constituting a class.186. Petitioner published a sentence \"Oriya is a younger sister of Bengal\" in his book. Subsequently petitioner published an apology in newspaper and deleted the controversial statement. In view of this it cannot be said that alleged sentence published to defame Oriya language or promote hatred between different linguistic groups. Criminal proceeding are quashed.187.\nThe police force of the State cannot be brought within the purview of the term \"community\".188."

The present section proceeds apparently upon a presumption that, in addition to any such duty, the owner or occupier of land is cognizant in a peculiar way of the designs of those who assemble on his land, and is able not only to give the police notice, but also to prevent and to disperse and suppress the assembly.212.\nSection 45 of the Cr PC, 1973, casts upon the owners and occupiers of land the duty of preventing a riot on their lands.\nKnowledge, on the part of the owner or occupier of the land, of the acts or intentions of the agent, is not an essential element of an offence under this section, and he may be convicted under it though he may be in entire ignorance of the acts of his agent or manager.213. According to some Police Regulations the Police are required to serve a warning notice on the landlord, owner, occupier or his agent or other person claiming interest in landed property contemplated in this and the two subsequent sections so that they may adopt every means in their power to prevent the unlawful assembly or rioting taking place on such property.214. This being a laudable objective there can possibly be no objection to the issuance of such a notice. It should, however, be remembered that a police-officer cannot and should not in the name of serving such a notice injunct the owner or occupier, even temporarily, from enjoying his property.215. The police have no such power under the law. To make a person cognizant about his duties under the law is one thing and to restrain the owner from enjoying his property is entirely a different thing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n212. M&M 128.\n213.

They must disturb the public peace.\n\nThe first basic ingredient of section 159, IPC, 1860, is fighting between two or more persons. The next ingredient is that the fighting should have been in public place and the last ingredient is that the fighting should have disturbed public peace.218.\n1. 'Two or more persons'.—An affray requires two persons at the least. An unlawful assembly requires five. The offence of Affray is a fight, i.e., a bilateral act, in which two parties participate and it will not amount to an affray when the party who is assaulted submits to the assault without resistance. Again, there must be a definite disturbance of the public peace due to the fight in the public place to make the offence affray.219.\n2. 'Fighting in a public place'.—'Public place' is a place where the public go, no matter whether they have a right to go or not. Many shows are exhibited to the public on private property, yet they are frequented by the public—the public go there.220.\nThe expression 'Fighting' in section 159, IPC, 1860, is used in its ordinary sense and it means a combat or quarrel involving exchange of some force or violence, if not blows. Mere verbal quarrel or vulgarly abusing sans violence cannot be construed as fighting which contemplates bilateral use of violence by two competing parties. Even if there is no exchange of blows, there should be exchange of some violence between the two contending parties before it can be said that the parties are fighting. If one person uses violence against another and the other person merely remains passive, it cannot be said that there is a fighting, so also, if neither person uses violence against the other but both the persons indulge in verbal abuses, it does not amount to fighting.221. Mere causing inconvenience to the public is not sufficient.222.\n\n3. 'Disturb the public peace'.—An affray is an offence against the public peace because it is committed in a public place and is likely to cause general alarm and disturbance. Mere causing public inconvenience is not enough.223. Before a conviction can be entered under section 160, IPC, 1860, there must be a clear finding by the court that the place of occurrence was a public place. If there is no such finding the accused persons must be acquitted.224."

While reversing the conviction passed by the High Court, the Supreme Court held that the offence under section 169 IPC, 1860 is incomplete without the assistance of some other enactment which imposes the legal prohibition required. Therefore, in order to come within the clutches of section 169 IPC, 1860, there should be a law which prohibits a public servant from purchasing certain property and if he does it, it becomes an offence under section 169 IPC, 1860. Section 481 of the Criminal Procedure Code, section 189 of the Railways Act, 1989 and section 19 of the Cattle Trespass Act, 1871 and instances of that nature in several enactments are available in which persons mentioned therein shall not directly or indirectly purchase any property at a sale under those Acts. Similarly section 136 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that no Judge, legal practitioner, or officer connected with any Court of Justice shall buy or traffic in, or stipulate for, or agree to receive any share of, or interest in, any actionable claim and no Court of Justice shall enforce, at his instance, or at the instance of any person claiming by or through him, any actionable claims so dealt with by him as stated above. Thus, in these circumstances where a law has prohibited purchase of property or to bid at an auction, the prohibition contained therein will be attracted and will become an offence under section 169 IPC, 1860. The Code of Conduct not having a statutory force and not enforceable in a Court of law, nor having any sanction or procedure for dealing with a contravention thereof by the Chief Minister, cannot be construed to impose a legal prohibition against the purchase of property of the Government so as to give rise to a criminal offence under section 169 IPC, 1860.15.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n14.

The person personating must do or attempt to do some act under colour of the office of the public servant whom he personates.

'Any act'.—It is not necessary that the act done or attempted to be done should be such an act as might legally be done by the public servant personated. The accused was arrested when he was demanding one anna's worth of fruit from a fruit-seller for one pie on the representation that he was a head constable, which in fact he was not. It was held that if he pretended to be a police-officer and tried as such police-officer to extort money or things from a fruit-seller, he was guilty of an offence under this section.16.

If it has no relation to the office, as if A pretending to be a servant of Government, travelling through a district, obtains money, provisions, etc., the offence may amount to cheating under section 415, but is not punishable under this section.18. The act done under colour of office must be an act which could not have been done without assuming official authority.\nWhere the accused posed as a police officer and in that garb looted certain articles from the complainant and the stolen articles, one police ballot and monogram were recovered from him, his conviction under the section was held to be proper.19."

It also includes offers or agreements to give or offer and attempts to procure a gratification for any person. 'Gratification' is already explained in section 161 of the Penal Code and is not restricted to pecuniary gratifications or to gratifications estimated in money.5. Section 171-B(1)(i) of Indian Penal Code provides that if gratification is given to any person inducing him or any other person to exercise any electoral right, then it will amount to bribery. The term \"Electoral right\" defined under clause (b) of section 171-A of Indian Penal Code clearly indicates that the electoral right is of definite nature and it is to be exercised by individual. So, the gratification has to be given to an individual. Here, the offer is made to the party (RPI) and not to any individual. Furthermore, there is nothing in the offer which indicates that any influence is being brought on any individual with respect to exercising his electoral right, that means, to stand, or not to stand as, or to withdraw from being, a candidate or to vote or to refrain from voting at the election. Seeking support of a political party, during the course of election and making an offer to political party of some share in political\n\npower for giving such support cannot be called as giving gratification as contemplated under section 171-B of Indian Penal Code.6. The word 'gratification' should be deemed to refer only to cases where a gift is made of something which gives a material advantage to the recipient. There is hardly any need to say that giving of anything whose value is estimable in money is bribery. A gun licence gives no material advantage to its recipient. It might gratify his sense of importance if he has a gun licence in a village where nobody else has a gun licence. So might be the conferment of an honour like Padma Bhushan. A praise from a high quarter might gratify the sense of vanity of a person. But the word 'gratification' as used in section 123 (1) does not refer to such gratification any more than in section 171-B of the Indian Penal Code.7."

[produce a document or an electronic record in a Court of Justice], with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nAbsconding to avoid summons.—Absconding to avoid service of summons or other proceeding is similar to non-attendance in obedience to an order from a public servant. The object of this section is to punish an offender for the contempt his conduct indicates of the authority whose process he disregards.\nThe second clause applies where the summons or notice or order is (1) for attendance in Court; or (2) for production of a document.\n1. 'Absconds'.—This term is not to be understood as implying necessarily that a person leaves the place in which he is. Its etymological and ordinary sense is to hide oneself; and it matters not whether a person departs from a place or remains in it, if he conceals himself. If a person, having concealed himself before process issues, continues to do so after it is issued, he absconds.2.\n2. 'Summons, notice or order'.—The summons, notice or order referred to, should be addressed to the same person whose attendance is required and who absconds to avoid being served with such a 'summons, notice or order'. A warrant is not an order served on an accused; it is simply an order to the police to arrest him.3. It is not an offence under this section to abscond to avoid arrest under a warrant.4."

A is guilty of the offence defined in this section.\n\n(b) A, a village watchman, knowing that a considerable body of strangers has passed through his village in order to commit a dacoity in the house of Z, a wealthy merchant residing in a neighbouring place, and being bound under clause, 5, section VII, Regulation III, 1821,40. of the Bengal Code, to give early and punctual information of the above fact to the officer of the nearest police station, wilfully misinforms the police officer that a body of suspicious characters passed through the village with a view to commit dacoity in a certain distant place in a different direction. Here A is guilty of the offence defined in the later part of this section.\n\n41.[Explanation.—In section 176 and in this section the word \"offence\" includes any act committed at any place out of 42.[India], which, if committed in 43. [India], would be punishable under any of the following sections, namely, 302, 304, 382, 392, 393, 394, 395, 396, 397, 398, 399, 402, 435, 436, 449, 450, 457,\n458, 459 and 460; and the word \"offender\" includes any person who is alleged to have been guilty of any such act.]\n\n\n\nFurnishing false information.—Section 176 deals with the omission to give information; this section deals with the giving of false information. Persons who are not under a legal obligation to furnish information cannot be dealt with under these sections.44. Furnishing false information is distinct from omission to give information. Omission to mention about a two-wheeler in the statement of assets and liabilities by a public servant is not an offence under section 177 IPC, 1860.45. It is clear that the accused having been aware of the fact that she belongs to \"Havyak Brahmin\" by caste, furnished false information to the authority and obtained admission by producing false caste certificate. The ingredients of section 177 are proved.46. In a case where the allegation was that the complainant filed false information in nomination paper, it was held that a complaint by the Returning officer is mandatory.47.\n\nThe appellant being a Sarpanch of the Gram Panchayat was legally bound to give correct information and issue a correct certificate but he issued a false certificate in favour of one Lal Chand that he does not own any land except the land which he has made fit for cultivation, in fact, though Lal Chand owned 13 kanals, 13 marlas and also his wife owned lands in the village Baruhi. Therefore, the ingredients of section 177 of the Code were proved as against him.48."

Under sections 121–132 of the Indian Evidence Act a witness is exempted from answering certain questions. If a person gives false answers, then he will be guilty under section 193 and not under this section.\nRefusing to answer the question of a police-officer investigating a case under section\n161 of the Criminal Procedure Code is not an offence under this section.52. This section also applies to the accused as the words used in section 161(1) Cr PC, 1973, are \"any person acquainted with facts and circumstances of the case\". Thus, the accused too is bound to answer a question put by a police-officer in course of his examination. However, the answer to a question has a tendency to incriminate him; he can claim protection under Article 20(3) of the Constitution and refuse to answer. Of course, it is a matter which has to be ultimately decided by the Court.53.\nThe matter is entirely different so far the officers of the Railway Protection Force are concerned first, they are not police-officers54. and second, the enquiry conducted by them under sections 8 and 9 of the Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966 is not a police investigation but should be deemed to be a judicial proceeding.55. Section 9 of this special Act specifically lays down that during such enquiry by an RPF officer, persons summoned have to obey summons and state the truth and, therefore, by refusing to answer, such persons would make themselves liable under section 179, IPC, 1860. The question of invoking Article 20(3) of the Constitution does not arise in such a case, as till the complaint is filed under section 190(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973 by the RPF officer, a person cannot be regarded as \"accused of an offence\" within the meaning of Article 20(3) of the Constitution.56.\n\n52.

Contempt of the lawful authority of Courts of Justice, of Officers of Revenue, Officers of Police, and other public servants are punishable under this head.\n\n67.[[s 182] False information, with intent to cause public servant to use his lawful power to the injury of another person.\nWhoever gives to any public servant any information 1 which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant—\n\n(a) to do or omit anything2 which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or\n\n(b) to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person,\nshall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.]\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A informs a Magistrate that Z, a police-officer, subordinate to such Magistrate, has been guilty of neglect of duty or misconduct, knowing such information to be false, and knowing it to be likely that the information will cause the Magistrate to dismiss Z. A has committed the offence defined in this section.\n\n(b) A falsely informs a public servant that Z has contraband salt in a secret place, knowing such information to be false, and knowing that it is likely that the consequence of the information will be a search of Z's premises, attended with annoyance to Z. A has committed the offence defined in this section.\n\n(c) A falsely informs a policeman that he has been assaulted and robbed in the neighbourhood of a particular village. He does not mention the name of any person as one of his assaitants, but knows it to be likely that in consequence of this information the police will make enquiries and institute searches in the village to the annoyance of the villages or some of them. A has committed an offence under this section.]\n\n\n\nObject.—The object of this section is that a public servant should not be falsely given information with the intent that he should be misled by a person who believed that information to be false, and intended to mislead him. This section does not require that action must always be taken if the person who makes the public servant knows or believes that action will be taken.68."

'Any information'.—The Bombay and the Patna High Courts have ruled that any 'false information' given to a public servant, with the intent mentioned in the section, is punishable under it whether that information is volunteered by the informant or is given in answer to questions put to him by the public servant.70. Where a driver of a motor vehicle, who had no licence with him, on being asked his name by a police-officer, gave a fictitious name, it was held that he had committed an offence under this section.71.\n\nThe section makes no distinction between information relating to a cognizable offence and one relating to a non-cognizable offence, nor is there anything in the section to justify the conclusion that it applies only to cases in which the information given to any public servant relates to a cognizable offence.72.\n2. 'To do or omit anything'.—It is not necessary that the public servant to whom false information is given should be induced to do anything or to omit to do anything in consequence of such information. The gist of the offence is not what action may or may not be taken by the public servant to whom false information is given, but the intention or knowledge (to be inferred from his conduct) of the person supplying such information.73. Section 182 does not require that action must always be taken if the person who moves the public servant knows or believes that action would be taken.74. Under this clause it is not necessary to show that the act done would be to the injury or annoyance of any third person.75."

It is mandatory to follow the procedure prescribed under section 195 of the Code while initiating action against an accused for an offence punishable under section 182, IPC, 1860 else such action is rendered void ab initio.77. Thus, investigation into an offence under section 182, IPC, 1860 can be done only on the complaint given by a competent public servant; taking note of the fact that the procedure contemplated is not complied within the line with section 195, Cr PC, 1973 as well as the settled legal position evolved through the decisions of the Apex Court, the cognizance assumed by the Magistrate for the offence under section 182, IPC, 1860 is erroneous and not sustainable in law.78. Similar view has been expressed by\n\nthe Hon'ble Supreme Court in PD Lakhani v State of Punjab,79. relying upon its earlier judgment in Daulat Ram's case (supra) and Mata Bhikh's case.80. It is held that:\nno complaint, therefore, could be lodged before the learned Magistrate by the Station House Officer. Even assuming that the same was done under the directions of SP, Section 195, in no uncertain terms, directs filing of an appropriate complaint petition only by the public servant concerned or his superior officer. It, therefore, cannot be done by an inferior officer. It does not provide for delegation of the function of the public servant concerned81."

      "content": "Whoever offers any resistance to the taking of any property by the lawful authority of any public servant, knowing or having reason to believe that he is such public servant, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section makes it penal to offer resistance to the taking of property by the lawful authority of any public servant. The Bombay High Court has held that there are no words in the section as there are in section 99, extending the operation of the section to acts which are not strictly justifiable by law. Resistance to an act of a public officer acting bona fide though in excess of his authority may give rise to some charge in the nature of assault, but it cannot afford any foundation for a prosecution under this section.90. The Madras High Court is of opinion that this section should be read in conjunction with section 99. Taking the two together, if an officer acts in good faith under colour of his office the mere circumstance that his \"act may not be strictly justifiable by law\" cannot affect the lawfulness of his authority. In this case, property had been seized in execution by the officer of the Court, and it was held that as the officer was acting bona fide, though he had wrongly seized the property of the accused, the accused could be convicted under this section for resisting the execution.91. This view of the law receives substantial support from the decision of the Supreme Court in Keshoram's case92. where too it has been held that merely because no prior notice was served on the accused before seizing his cattle under the Delhi Municipal Act for recovering arrears of milk tax, it could not be said that the municipal officer's action was entirely illegal and as such the accused had the right of private defence against the bona fide act of the public servant. In the instant case the accused was held to have been rightly convicted under sections 353/332/333, IPC, 1860, for assaulting the public servant. On a parity of reasoning it can be said that had the accused been prosecuted under section 183 of the Code, he could have also been convicted under that section as well."

[Vide A.P.G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section provides for voluntarily obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his duties. It must be shown that the obstruction or resistance was offered to a public servant in the discharge of his duties or public functions as authorised by law. The mere fact of a public servant believing that he was acting in the discharge of his duties will not be sufficient to make resistance or obstruction to him amount to an offence.100. If the public servant is acting in good faith under colour of his office there is no right of private defence against his act.101.\n\nThe word \"obstruction\" connotes some overt act in the nature of violence or show of violence.102. To constitute \"obstruction\", it is not necessary that there should be actual criminal force. It is sufficient if there is either a show of force or a threat or any act preventing the execution of any act by a public servant.103. Though an offence under this section is a non-cognizable one, by virtue of powers vested in the State Government under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932, it can be made a cognizable offence in a specified area by means of a notification, while such notification remains in force."

It is also not possible to bypass the requirements of section 195(1)(a), Cr PC, 1973, by merely changing the label of the offence, say from section 186 to section 353, IPC, 1860.104."

When the servant put his scythe to the hedge to cut it, the accused caught hold of the scythe and threatened him. It was held that the accused was guilty of an offence under this section, since his laying hold of the scythe amounted to physical obstruction, and the obstruction offered to the servant was tantamount to obstruction to the Circle Inspector under whose orders he was acting.107. The daughter of the tenant of the accused died of electrocution. The police-officers entered the premises with permission to check fresh wiring and leakage of current. They were prevented from taking photographs by the accused and also not allowed to leave the house. The Court said that this amounted to obstruction within the meaning of section 186 and wrongful confinement within the meaning of section 342.108. Section 186 contemplates obstruction of a public servant in the discharge of his public duty and section 332 contemplates voluntarily causing hurt to him to deter him from performing his public duty.

A case was registered against the accused/ Sub-Inspector of Police under section 187 of the IPC, 1860 for not assisting the Assisting Sessions Judge, in the service of summons to witnesses and administration of justice. In the light of the language employed in sections 195(1) of Cr PC, 1973, the prosecution initiated at the instance of the Assistant Sessions Judge cannot be sustained for the reason that the Sub-Inspector of Police is not subordinate to the said Officer. Unless a complaint is made by the competent officer as specified under section 195(1) of the Code, the prosecution cannot be further proceeded with. Apart from this aspect of the matter, in as much as the service of summons, being in discharge of the official duties of the Sub-Inspector, sanction under section 197 of the code is also required.113.\n\n112.

It is suﬃcient that he knows of the order which he disobeys, and that his disobedience produces, or is likely to produce, harm.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nAn order is promulgated by a public servant lawfully empowered to promulgate such order, directing that a religious procession shall not pass down a certain street. A knowingly disobeys the order, and thereby causes danger of riot. A has committed the offence defined in this section.\n\n\n\nThe offence under this section has now been made a cognizable offence under the Cr PC, 1973. Though a bailable offence, it can be made non-bailable by a notification by the State Government under section 10(2) of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.\nThere must be evidence that the accused had knowledge of the order with the disobedience of which he is charged. Mere proof of a general notification promulgating the order does not satisfy the requirements of the section.114. \"Promulgation\" does not require publication in newspapers or by posters.115. Mere disobedience of an order does not constitute an offence in itself; it must be shown that the disobedience has or tends to a certain consequence,116. namely, annoyance, obstruction, etc. The annoyance has to be proved as a fact; mere mental annoyance of the authorities concerned is not enough.117. It is also necessary to see that the order was not only lawfully made but duly promulgated and the accused had knowledge of the order, else his conviction cannot be sustained.118. Where a standing crop was attached by means of an order under section 145 Cr PC, 1973 and the accused, who had come to know the order, reaped and removed the crop, an offence under this section was held to have been committed. It was a disobedience packed with a tendency to cause riot or affray.119. The complaint of this offence must disclose that the disobedience of the order led to the consequences narrated in clauses (2) and (3) of section 188, IPC, 1860, otherwise no cognizance can be taken on such a complaint.120. It is not necessary that, if the order disobeyed was that of a civil Court, a complaint should be received from that Court. A criminal Court can entertain a complaint of disobedience from any other source.121.\nIt is open to a person charged under this section to plead in defence that the order, though made with jurisdiction, was utterly wrong or improper on merits.122."

[Vide A.P.G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nUnder this section there must be a threat of injury either to the public servant or to any one in whom the accused believes the public servant to be interested. What the section deals with are menaces which would have a tendency to induce the public servant to alter his action. See section 503 which defines criminal intimidation and applies in all cases. This section deals with criminal intimidation of a public servant. Threats of violence to a public servant who accepted bribe money but did not do the promised work are not covered by this section. A public servant deserves protection, since in the performance of his duties, he is likely to cause disappointment to many and invite their wrath. That is why under sections 189 and 353 and various other sections of the IPC, 1860, a public servant is strongly protected and punishment for offences against him is made deterrent. However if a public servant has gone astray and indulged in malpractices, more especially by way of taking bribe, he would necessarily become subject to public criticism and private accountability. What appears then at the forefront is not the performance of duty by the public servant, but the non-performance of some contract dehors the normal functions of the public servant. If that illegal contract gives rise to any act of violence at any stage, such acts cannot constitute by any stretch of imagination acts contemplated and punished under sections 353 and 189, IPC, 1860.128.\nWhere workers of Communist Party (Marxist) went to a police station to protest against the arrest of their party workers and in the process asked the police-officer to release them on threat of dire consequences, it was held that the accused had committed an offence under this section.129.

Ms. No. 732, dated 5th December, 1991].\n\n\n\nJUSTICE\n\nUnder the Indian Penal Code, 1860 offences relating to false evidence and offences against public justice are contained in Chapter XI. In relation to proceeding in any Court, the offences enumerated are: giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence (sections 191–193); giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction (sections 194 and 195); threatening any person to give false evidence (section 195A); using evidence known to be false (section 196); using as true a certificate known to be false (section 198); making a false statement in a declaration which is by law receivable as evidence (section 199); using as true any declaration receivable as evidence, knowing it to be false (section 200); causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender (section 201); intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform (section 202); giving false information in respect of an offence (section 203); destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence (section 204); false personation (section 205); fraudulent removal/concealment of property (section 206); fraudulent claim to property (section 207); fraudulently suffering or obtaining decree for sum not due (section 208 and section 210); dishonestly making a false claim in Court (section 209); and intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceedings (section 228). Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 172–188 (dealing with the contempt of the lawful authority of public servants) or section 193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of that Court by such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.1."

      "content": "Whoever, being legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law to state the truth, or being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject,1 makes any statement which is false,2. and which he either knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true,3. is said to give false evidence.\nExplanation 1.—A statement is within the meaning of this section, whether it is made verbally or otherwise.\nExplanation 2.—A false statement as to the belief of the person attesting is within the meaning of this section, and a person may be guilty of giving false evidence by stating that he believes a thing which he does not believe, as well as by stating that he knows a thing which he does not know.\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A, in support of a just claim which B has against Z for one thousand rupees, falsely swears on a trial that he heard Z admit the justice of B's claim. A has given false evidence.\n\n(b) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he believes a certain\n\nsignature to be the handwriting of Z, when he does not believe it to be the handwriting of Z. Here A states that which he knows to be false, and therefore gives false evidence.\n\n(c) A, knowing the general character of Z's handwriting, states that he believes a certain signature to be the handwriting of Z; A in good faith believing it to be so. Here A's statement is merely as to his belief, and is true as to his belief, and therefore, although the signature may not be the handwriting of Z, A has not given false evidence.\n\n(d) A, being bound by an oath to state the truth, states that he knows that Z was at a particular place on a particular day, not knowing anything upon the subject. A gives false evidence whether Z was at that place on the day named or not.\n\n(e) A, an interpreter or translator, gives or certifies as a true interpretation or translation of a statement or document which he is bound by oath to interpret or translate truly, that which is not and which he does not believe to be a true interpretation or translation. A has given false evidence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nIngredients.—The offence under this section involves three ingredients:—\n\n(1) A person must be legally bound;\n(a) by an oath, or any express provision of law, to state the truth; or\n(b) to make a declaration upon any subject.\n(2) He must make a false statement.\n(3) He must;\n(a) know or believe it to be false, or\n(b) not believe it to be true.\n\n1. 'Legally bound by an oath or by an express provision of law, etc.'— In case the recourse to a false plea is taken with an oblique motive, it would definitely hinder, hamper or impede the flow of justice and prevent the Courts from performing their legal duties.2 The Courts have to follow the procedures strictly and cannot allow a witness to escape the legal action for giving false evidence before the Court on mere explanation that he had given it under the pressure of the police or for some other reason. Whenever the witness speaks falsehood in the Court, and it is proved satisfactorily, the Court should take a serious action against such witnesses.3 It is necessary that the accused should be legally bound by an oath before a competent authority. If the Court has no authority to administer an oath the proceeding will be coram non judice and a prosecution for false evidence will not stand.4. Similarly, if the Court is acting beyond its jurisdiction it will not be sustained.5. For the essentiality of section 191, petitioner must have been legally bound to speak truth or make a declaration and he must have stated or declared what is false. He must also know or believe what he has stated or declared is false or he has believed it true. If there is no compulsion to make any declaration as required by law, Section 191 will not have any\n\napplication. The information given by him is not on any oath nor was he bound to give such information under any provision of Law.6."

'Knows or believes to be false or does not believe to be true'.—The matter sworn to must be either false in fact, or, if true, the accused must not have known it to be so. The making of a false statement, without knowledge as to whether the subject-matter of the statement is false or not, is legally the giving of false evidence.13. Where a man swears to a particular fact, without knowing at the time whether the fact be true or false, it is as much perjury as if he knew the fact to be false, and equally indictable.14. However, a man cannot be convicted of perjury for having acted rashly, or for having failed to make reasonable inquiry with regard to the facts alleged by him to be true.15."

In India a prosecution for perjury seems to be possible in such a case by virtue of illustration (e) of section 221, The Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973, it has been held to be inexpedient to do so in the interest of justice. Thus, where a person made one statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973 and a diametrically opposite statement in Court during the enquiry or trial, he could in view of this illustration be charged in the\n\nalternative and convicted of intentionally giving false evidence, although it cannot be proved which of these contradictory statements was false. But to do so may be to tie him down to his previous false statement under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, and preventing him from telling the truth even belatedly at the later stage of enquiry or trial. The Supreme Court too has felt that a witness whose statement has been recorded under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, feels tied to his previous statement and as such his evidence has to be approached with caution.17. In the instant case as it could not be shown that the earlier statements of the witnesses recorded under section 164 Cr PC, 1973 were true and those given before the Magistrate in course of the enquiry were false, the complaints of perjury filed against the witnesses were directed to be withdrawn.18."

During the examination, the Court insisted him to give a definite opinion that too without examining the firearm. At that time, he opined that the cartridges appeared to have been fired from two separate firearms. Considering that there was a deliberate deviation in his opinion the High Court initiated proceedings against him under section 340 Cr PC, 1973 for perjury.

In relation to proceeding in any Court, the offences enumerated are: giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence (sections 191–193); giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction (sections 194 and 195); threatening any person to give false evidence (section 195A); using evidence known to be false (section 196); using as true a certificate known to be false (section 198); making a false statement in a declaration which is by law receivable as evidence (section 199); using as true any declaration receivable as evidence, knowing it to be false (section 200); causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender (section 201); intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform (section 202); giving false information in respect of an offence (section 203); destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence (section 204); false personation (section 205); fraudulent removal/concealment of property (section 206); fraudulent claim to property (section 207); fraudulently suffering or obtaining decree for sum not due (section 208 and section 210); dishonestly making a false claim in Court (section 209); and intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceedings (section 228). Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 172–188 (dealing with the contempt of the lawful authority of public servants) or section 193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of that Court by such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.1."

    "section192.1": {
      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "The offence defined in this section has three ingredients:—\n\n(1) Causing any circumstance to exist, or making any false entry in any book or record, or making any document containing a false statement.\n(2) Doing one of the above acts with the intention that it may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant or an arbitrator.\n(3) Doing such act with the intention that it may cause any person, who in such proceeding, is to form an opinion upon the evidence to entertain an erroneous opinion touching any point material to the result of such proceeding.43. From a careful reading of section 192, IPC, 1860, what transpires is that whoever forges a document, containing false statement or false entry, intending that such false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in a judicial proceeding, or in a proceeding taken by law before a public servant as such, so appearing in evidence, may cause any person, who, in such proceeding, is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion in such proceeding, he is said to fabricate false evidence.44.\n1. 'Judicial proceeding'.—The Code of Criminal Procedure says that 'judicial proceeding' includes any proceeding in the course of which evidence is or may be legally taken on oath [section 2(i)]. The power to take evidence on oath, which includes affirmation as well,45. is the characteristic test of 'judicial proceeding'. 'Judicial proceeding' means nothing more or less than a step taken by a Court in the course of administration of justice in connection with a case.46. Execution proceedings are judicial proceedings.47.\nIt is not essential that there should be any judicial proceeding pending at the time of fabrication. It is enough that there is a reasonable prospect of such a proceeding having regard to the circumstances of the case and that the document in question is intended to be used in such a proceeding.48.\n2. 'Public servant'.—The provisions of this section are not confined to false evidence to be used in judicial proceedings, but to any proceeding before a public servant. A Government correspondence was stealthily removed by accused No. 1 and handed over to the pleader of accused Nos. 2 and 3. The correspondence was replaced by accused No. 1. It was afterwards discovered that some papers had disappeared from the correspondence whilst others had been either mutilated or altered. It was held that accused Nos. 2 and 3 were guilty of offences under sections 466 and 193.49.\n\n3. 'Material'.—The false evidence under this section should be material to the case in which it is given though not so under section 191.50. The word 'material' means of such a nature as to affect in any way, directly or indirectly, the probability of anything to be determined by the proceeding, or the credit of any witness, and a fact may be material although evidence of its existence was improperly admitted.51.\n4. 'Fabricate'.—The term fabrication refers to the fabrication of false evidence; and if the evidence fabricated is intended to be used in a judicial proceeding, the offence is committed as soon as the fabrication is complete; it is immaterial that the judicial proceeding has not been commenced,52. or that no actual use has been made of the evidence fabricated. The mere fabrication is punishable under section 193; the use of the fabricated evidence is punishable under section 196.\nThe evidence fabricated must be admissible evidence.53."

    "section192.2": {
      "title": "Liability of accused for fabricating false evidence.—",
      "content": "It has been held by the High Courts of Calcutta54. and Bombay55. that an offender who fabricates false evidence to screen himself from punishment is liable to be convicted under this section. The Allahabad High Court56. has veered round to the same view, after distinguishing an earlier case57. to the contrary."
    },
    "section192.3": {
      "title": "Vicarious liability.—",
      "content": "Neither section 192 IPC, 1860 nor section 199 IPC, 1860, incorporate the principle of vicarious liability, and therefore, it was incumbent on the complainant to specifically aver the role of each of the accused in the complaint.58. Penal Code does not contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the managing Director or the Director for the Company when the accused is the company. Vicarious liability arise provided any provision exits in that behalf in the statute. It is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provision constituting vicarious liability.59."

      "content": "The brother of an accused person applied to the Court on behalf of the accused asking that the witnesses for the prosecution might first be made to identify the accused. The Court assenting to this request, he produced before the Court ten or twelve men, none of whom could be identified as the accused by any of the witnesses. Upon being asked by the Court where the accused was, he pointed out a man who was not the accused. It was held that he was guilty of fabricating false evidence.60. The accused, who was in possession of the complainant's house as a yearly tenant, about the time the tenancy came to an end, prepared another rent-note for a period of four years and got it registered without the complainant's knowledge. It was held that the accused had fabricated false evidence inasmuch as the rent-note, which contained an admission against the interest of the accused, could be admitted in evidence on his behalf.61.

In relation to proceeding in any Court, the offences enumerated are: giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence (sections 191–193); giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction (sections 194 and 195); threatening any person to give false evidence (section 195A); using evidence known to be false (section 196); using as true a certificate known to be false (section 198); making a false statement in a declaration which is by law receivable as evidence (section 199); using as true any declaration receivable as evidence, knowing it to be false (section 200); causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender (section 201); intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform (section 202); giving false information in respect of an offence (section 203); destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence (section 204); false personation (section 205); fraudulent removal/concealment of property (section 206); fraudulent claim to property (section 207); fraudulently suffering or obtaining decree for sum not due (section 208 and section 210); dishonestly making a false claim in Court (section 209); and intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceedings (section 228).

      "title": "Punishment for false evidence.",
      "content": "Whoever intentionally gives false evidence in any stage of a judicial proceeding, or fabricates false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding,1 shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine, and whoever intentionally gives or fabricates false evidence in any other case,2 shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\nExplanation 1.—A trial before a Court-martial; 67.

As this enquiry is a stage of a judicial proceeding. A has given false evidence.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nSections 191 and 192 define the offences punishable under this section. The first paragraph applies only to cases in which the false evidence is given in a judicial proceeding, the second to all other cases. If the offence is committed in any stage of a judicial proceeding it is more severely punishable than when it is committed in a non- judicial proceeding.\nIntention is the essential ingredient in the constitution of this offence. If the statement was false, and known or believed by the accused to be false, it may be presumed that in making that statement he intentionally gave false evidence. In order to make a person liable for perjury it is necessary that he should have made a statement on oath regarding the facts on which his statement was based and then deny those facts on oath on a subsequent occasion.68. The mere fact that a deponent has made contradictory statements at two different stages in a judicial proceeding is not by itself always sufficient to justify a prosecution for perjury under section 193 but it must be established that the deponent has intentionally given false statement in any stage of the 'judicial proceeding' or fabricated false evidence for the purpose of being used in any stage of the 'judicial proceeding'.69.\n\nIt is not necessary that the false statement should be material to the case. The gist of the offence is the giving or fabrication of false evidence intentionally. Where knowledge of falsity is proved, intention is readily presumed.70.\n1. 'Any stage of a judicial proceeding'.—The recording of a statement under section 161 itself is a judicial proceeding in view of Explanation 2 to section 193 in so far as recording of a statement is part of the investigation directed by law preliminary to a proceeding before a Court of justice and therefore is a stage of the judicial proceedings. Mere failure to support contention made in said FIR while giving evidence under section 164 Cr PC, 1973, can't conclusively lead to hold that he had given false evidence by departing from contentions made in FIR.71. Where a witness in Sessions trial deposing contrary to what he had said in a statement recorded under section 164, recourse to section 340 cannot be taken without first deciding whether the earlier statement was false.72. In the course of proceedings for execution of a decree in a Court which had no jurisdiction to entertain such proceedings the judgment-debtor made a false statement and produced a forged receipt. The Court made a complaint under section 195 of the Criminal Procedure Code for prosecution of the judgment- debtor in respect of the said offences; it was held that if during the course of the proceedings which were ultra vires and illegal any offence under section 471 of the Code was committed, it could not be said that it was committed in or in relation to, or by a party to, any judicial proceedings, in which evidence could be legally taken, and therefore the complaint must be dismissed.73. Since enquiry conducted by an officer of the Railway Protection Force is a judicial proceeding under section 9 of The Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act, 1966, furnishing of false documents in course of\n\nsuch an enquiry would amount to an offence under section 193, IPC, 1860.74. Giving false evidence in support of the prosecution case during the course of trial falls within the ambit of sections 193 and 195, IPC, 1860, and not under section 211, IPC, 1860, as there is no institution of criminal proceeding in such a case.75. (See Comments under sub-head \"Falsely Charges\" under section 211 infra.) Where the accused abetted the offence of forgery by creating a false document with a view to use it in a suit but did not use it in the suit, it was held that there was no question of prosecuting him under section 193, IPC, 1860, nor was a Court complaint under section 195(1) (b) (i), Cr PC, 1973, necessary in the case. The accused could be safely prosecuted under section 467 read with section 114, IPC, 1860, on a private complaint.76.\nWhere the accused police-officer asked a police official to forge the signature of his superior on the carbon copy of the counter-affidavit containing false averments and the same was filed in the Supreme Court with that forged signature, the accused was held guilty of an offence under section 192.77.\nQuestions which a person is compelled to answer and the answers which have a tendency to incriminate, cannot be the sole basis of a charge of perjury.78."

Anyone who makes an attempt to impede or undermine or obstruct the free flow of the unsoiled stream of justice by resorting to the filing of false evidence commits criminal contempt of the Court and renders himself liable to be dealt with in accordance with the Act.

Court set aside the order of acquittal of the accused, ordered re-trial and directed to proceed under sections 193 and 195A.87. After a long span of time, the prosecution witnesses filed a false affidavit stating that they were coerced and tutored by police. They were held liable for perjury.88.\n\n2. 'In any other case'.—A statement made in the course of a public investigation under section 164 of the Code of Criminal Procedure comes within these words.89. Whether the accused has really made a false statement or not is a question of fact, which can be decided at the trial and not in quashing proceeding, when the allegations, which have been made against the accused do make out a prima facie case under section 193, IPC, 1860.90. A person married the daughter of his maternal uncle, after converting to Christianity. If they married before conversion this marriage would have come under 'Sapindas relations' which is prohibited under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. After conversion into Christianity the marriage does not fall under 'Sapinda' relationship. It\n\ncannot be said that there was any false declaration. It is held that offence punishable under section 193 of IPC, 1860 is not made out.91."

Furthermore, the penal provision under section 193 IPC, 1860 has to be understood giving significance to the expressions 'intentionally giving or fabricating false evidence', 'in any stage of a judicial proceeding' or 'in any other case.' Giving or fabricating false evidence in the aforesaid section whether it be in the judicial proceeding or in any other case must have been intended to form an opinion on the evidence erroneously and such forming of opinion should be touching the point material to the result of such proceeding. Viewed in that angle the declaration to be made by a candidate in his affidavit filed with his nomination paper over the matters prescribed by the election commission when he contests an election, it cannot be stated that the candidate is giving evidence by affidavit but at best only a declaration on the particulars sought for. If the candidate fails to furnish information or gives false information which he knows or has reason to believe to be false or conceals any information he is liable to be prosecuted only for the offence under section 125A of the Act, and not for the penal offence under section 193 IPC, 1860.92."

      "content": "1973.—\n\nPower to punish under section 344 Cr PC, 1973 and section 193 Cr PC, 1973 are distinct. Section 344 Cr PC, 1973 calls for summary trial, whereas under section 193 IPC, 1860 offender is to be tried as warrant case. Section 344 Cr PC, 1973 vests powers in the Courts to summarily try and punish the accused. It is for this reason that section 344 Cr PC, 1973 prescribes sentence also. The Judge either should have convicted the petitioner under section 344 Cr PC, 1973 or ought not to have invoked section 193 IPC, 1860. Once, the Judge opted to try the petitioner for the offence under section 193 IPC, 1860, it was incumbent upon him to hold an inquiry under section 340 Cr PC, 1973 and then to frame a charge and try the offender for a warrant case as minimum sentence prescribed under section 193 IPC, 1860 is three years.93. Before lodging a complaint as provided by section 340 of the Code, the Court has to record a finding of any (i) prima facie case and deliberate falsehood on a matter of substance; (ii) there is reasonable foundation for the charge; and (iii) it is expedient in the interest of justice that a complaint should be filed.94. An enquiry when made, under section 340 (1) Cr PC, 1973, is really in the nature of affording a locus paenitentiae to a person and if at that stage the Court chooses to take action, it does not mean that he will not have full and adequate opportunity in due course of the process of justice to establish his innocence. When the trial of the appellant commences under section 193, IPC, 1860 the reasons given or those in the order passed under section 340 (1), Cr PC, 1973 should not weigh with the criminal Court in coming to its independent conclusion whether the offence under section 193, IPC, 1860 has been fully established against the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.95.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Sections 202 and 203 relate to the giving or omitting to give such information, and section 204 to the destruction of documentary evidence.\nThere are three groups of sections in the Code relating to the giving of information. First, sections 118–120 deal with concealment of a design to commit an offence; second sections 176, 177, 181 and 182 deal with omission to give information and with the giving of false information; and, third, sections 201–203 deal with causing the disappearance of evidence."

      "title": "Scope.—",
      "content": "The Supreme Court has held that this section is not restricted to the case of a person who screens the actual offender; it can be applied even to a person guilty of the main offence, though as a matter of practice a Court will not convict a person both of the main offence and under this section.133.\nBut, if the commission of the main offence is not brought home to the accused, then he can be convicted under this section.134. Where it is impossible to say definitely that a person has committed the principal offence he cannot escape conviction under this section merely because there are grounds for suspicion that he might be the principal culprit.135. A woman's husband and in-laws could not be convicted of murdering her because there was no evidence whatsoever. They were convicted under this section because they gave no reasonable explanation of the unnatural death and had also disposed of the body in suspicious circumstances (dead body found near railway track).136. The fact that the accused persons cannot be convicted for offence punishable under section 302 IPC, 1860 does not extricate them from the offence under section 201 IPC, 1860.137. In a case of bride burning, where the post-mortem report was that death was due to throttling, burning her subsequently was held to be a clear proof of the fact that the evidence of strangulation was sought to be destroyed by the accused husband by pouring kerosene and setting her ablaze. The conviction of the husband under sections 201, 302 and 498-A was held to be proper.138.\n\nA statement given by a person in the course of an investigation by the police cannot amount to an offence under this section and section 203, even if it ultimately turns out to be false.139. The allegation against the appellant was that, he had deliberately shielded the real offenders in the murder case and was accordingly liable for the offence under section 201 of the IPC, 1860. Supreme Court acquitted the accused\n\nholding that it is not possible on the evidence to ascertain, as to whether the appellant was, in fact, guilty of the offence alleged against him.140.\nThe Supreme Court has held that where the evidence showed that a person had died and his body was found in a trunk and discovered in a well, and that the accused had taken part in the disposal of the body but there was no evidence to show the cause of his death, or the manner or circumstances in which it came about, it was held that the accused could not be convicted for an offence under this section.141. In other words, the mere secreting of a dead body without first proving that the corpse secreted was the corpus delicti of a murder case is no offence under section 201, IPC, 1860.142."

Mere suspicion is not sufficient, it must be proved that the accused knew or had a reason to believe that the offence has been committed and yet he caused the evidence to disappear so as to screen the offender. The offender may be either himself or any other person.143. It has been held that the offence under the section is of independent nature, though it cannot be separated from the substance of the main offence. Accordingly, a conviction under the section can be recorded even though the commission of the main offence is not established. The Court, however, pointed out that such cases are likely to be very small in number. Applying this to the facts of the case, the Court held that the accused was guilty of offence under this section because he had buried the dead body of his wife in his field and misguided the police of her disappearance, though, because of decomposition, it could not be proved that he was responsible for her death.144."

'Knowing or having reason to believe that an offence has been committed'.—It must be proved that an offence, the evidence of which the accused is charged with causing to disappear, has actually been committed,146. and that the accused knew, or had information sufficient to lead him to believe, that the offence had been committed.147. Unless the prosecution was able to establish that the accused person knew or had reason to believe that an offence has been committed and had done something causing the offence of commission of evidence to disappear, he cannot be convicted.148.\n\nWhere the accused committed rape on a seven-year-old minor girl at his studio, killed her and disposed of her dead body in a carton. The dead body of the deceased was found in the carton, which the accused procured from witness. Conviction under sections 302, 376 and 201 IPC, 1860 is maintained.149.\nThe charge framed was for causing disappearance for evidence. The fact that concealment was the likely effect of the Act is not enough. There was no evidence to attribute the knowledge of the death of the victim woman to the accused. Hence, the essential ingredient of the offence was missing.150."

Where the Court has no case that there is any intentional omission to give information by the accused to the police, the conviction under section 201 cannot be maintained only on the ground that no communication was given to the police and that the post-mortem had not been performed. It is also no case of the complainant that he had requested for post- mortem of the body and that intimation should have been given to the police before the last rites were performed and there is also no charge under section 202 of the IPC, 1860 of intentionally omitting to give information of the unnatural death to the police.152.\n2. 'Intention of screening offence of offender'.—The intention to screen the offender must be the primary and sole object of the accused. The fact that the concealment was likely to have that effect is not sufficient.153. The accused person killed his brother and his whole family in order to avoid partition of the joint family property. There was no evidence to show that his son had common intention with him or participated in the commission of the crime. But because he had seen his father commit multiple murders, he tried to destroy the evidence by throwing away certain articles on two occasions from over a bridge. It seemed obvious that he had done that with the primary object of saving his father. He was convicted under this section.154.\n\nWhere a man shot down his wife with his pistol, his companion, who played no other role, but concealed the authorship of the homicide, he was held guilty under this section.155. Where the co-accused persons told the investigating officer that the deceased was not present in the house at the material time, it was held that this amounted to the offence of screening the offender.156."

In another case where the accused committed murder of his wife assaulting on her head with a chopper did cause the evidence to disappear by setting fire to the dead body after pouring kerosene on her, it is found that the accused has committed an offence punishable under sections 302 and 201 of IPC, 1860.158. Where unnatural conduct of appellants to dispose of dead body of victim without having awaited for victim's husband who was already on his way to home and the evidence shows that victim died under unnatural circumstances, conviction under sections 302 and 201 IPC, 1860 is upheld.159.

A person who assists the actual murderers in removing the corpse of their victim to a distance from the place where the murder was committed is prima facie guilty of an offence under this section, until he can establish that he acted under compulsion.162. Where it appeared from the statement of the accused that he took from the men who, according to him committed the murder, a jewel which was unquestionably the property of the deceased and he hid it and produced it later, it was held that the accused, when he hid the jewel, had the intention of screening the offender, whoever he was, from legal punishment and so was guilty of an offence under this section.163.

If a case gets no further than a police inquiry, it falls within that part. But under the second part there should be an actual institution of criminal proceedings on a false charge.225. Two conditions are necessary before the enhanced punishment provided in the second paragraph could be inflicted: (1) proceedings on the false charge should have been actually instituted, and (2) the false charge must be in respect of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards."

    "section211.1": {
      "title": "Sections 182 and 211.—",
      "content": "According to the Bombay High Court there is a clear distinction between a false charge that falls under section 211 and false information given to the police, in which latter case the offence falls under section 182. A person prosecuting another under section 182 need not prove malice and want of reasonable and probable cause except so far as they are implied in the act of giving information known to be false, with the knowledge or likelihood that such information would lead a public servant to use his power to the injury or annoyance of the complainant. In an inquiry under section 211, on the other hand, proof of the absence of just and lawful ground for making the charge is an important element.226. If the information conveyed to the police amounts to the institution of criminal proceedings against a defined person or amounts to the falsely charging of a defined person with an offence, then the person giving such information is guilty of an offence under section 211. In such a case, section 211 is, and section 182 is not, the appropriate section under which to frame a charge. Section 182, when read with section 211, must be understood as referring to cases where the information given to the public servant falls short of amounting to institution of criminal proceedings against a defined person and falls short of amounting to the falsely charging of a defined person with an offence as defined in the Penal Code.227.\nThe Calcutta, the Madras, the Allahabad and the Patna High Courts differ from this view of the Bombay High Court. The Calcutta High Court has ruled that a prosecution for a false charge may be under section 182 or section 211, but if the false charge was a serious one, the graver section 211 should be applied and the trial should be full and fair.228. Where a false charge is made to the police of a cognizable offence the offence committed by the person making the charge falls within the meaning of section 211 and not section 182.229.\n\nThe Madras High Court has held that there is no error in a conviction under section 182, when the false charge made before the police was punishable under the final clause of section 211. The High Court may quash the conviction and sentence for the minor offence and direct a trial before a tribunal having jurisdiction for the graver offence.\n\nWhether it will do so, or not, is a question, not of law, but of expediency on the facts of the particular case.230.\nThe Allahabad High Court had held that where a specific false charge is made, the proper section, for proceedings to be adopted under section 211.231. Although it is difficult to see what case would arise under section 211 to which section 182 could not be applied yet section 182 would apply to a case that might not fall under section 211. The offence under section 182 is complete when false information is given to a public servant by a person who believes it to be false, but who intends thereby to cause such public servant to institute criminal proceedings against a third person. The offence is complete although the public servant takes no steps towards the institution of such criminal proceedings. There is no restriction imposed by the Penal Code or by the Criminal Procedure Code upon the prosecution of an offence either under section 182 or section 211. It appears that it has been left to the discretion of the Court to determine when and under what circumstances prosecution should be proceeded with under sections 182 and 211.232. The soundness of this view is doubted in subsequent cases.233.\nThe Patna High Court has followed the view of the Calcutta High Court.234.\n\nThe Lahore High Court has held that an offence under section 182 is included in the more serious offence under section 211 and a prosecution for a false charge may be either under section 182 or section 211, though clearly if section 211 does apply and the false charge is serious, the prosecution should be under section 211.235.\n\n1. 'Intent to cause injury'.—This is an essential part of the offence.236.\n\n2. 'Institutes or causes to be instituted any criminal proceedings'.—The word \"proceedings\" is used in this section in the ordinary sense of a prescribed mode of action for prosecuting a right or redressing a wrong. It is not used in the technical sense of a proceeding taken in a Court of law.237. Neither the proceedings before the Disciplinary Committee of the Bar Council of India, is a criminal proceeding nor was the charge in the Disciplinary Proceedings in relation to an offence. Charge in the Disciplinary Proceedings before the Bar Council of India is only in respect of professional misconduct and not offence as such.238. Under this section 'instituting a criminal proceeding' may be treated as an offence in itself apart from 'falsely charging' a person with having committed an offence. There are two modes in which a person aggrieved may seek to put the criminal law in motion: (1) by giving information to the police (Criminal Procedure Code, section 154) and (2) by lodging a complaint before a Magistrate (Criminal Procedure Code, sections 190, 200). A person who sets the criminal law in motion by making to the police a false charge in respect of a cognizable offence institutes criminal proceedings.239. But as the police have no power to take any proceedings in non-cognizable cases without orders from a Magistrate, a false charge of such offence, made to the police, is not an institution of criminal proceedings, but merely a false charge.240. The distinction between cognizable and non-cognizable offences relates to the powers of the police only, and it will, therefore, seem that the false charge of any offence, whether cognizable or non-cognizable, before a Magistrate is an institution of criminal proceedings.\n\n3. 'Falsely charges'.—The word 'charges' means something different from 'gives information'. The true test seems to be, does the person who makes the statement that is alleged to constitute the 'charge' do so with the intention and object of setting the criminal law in motion against the person against whom the statement is directed? Such object and intention may be inferred from the language of the statement and the circumstances in which it is made.241. The false charge must be made to a Court, or to an officer who has power to investigate and send it up for trial.242. Where the tribunal\n\nbefore whom the complaint is made is not competent to take any action direct or indirect to punish the persons complained against, it cannot be said that the accused 'charged' such persons with any offence or that his intention necessarily was that action should be taken against them.243. A false petition to the Superintendent of Police, praying for the protection of the petitioners from the oppression of a Sub- Inspector, which may be effected by some departmental action, does not amount to such a false charge.244. It is enough that a false charge is made though no prosecution is instituted thereon.245. Where a person who gives false information as to the commission of an offence merely states that he suspected a certain other person to be the offender, it may be that he would not be liable under this section, but where it is clear that the informant's intention was not merely that the police should follow up a clue but that they should put the alleged offender on trial, the informant is guilty of an offence under this section.246. The Calcutta High Court has held that the meaning of the expression 'falsely charges' is simply 'falsely accuses' and as the section stands there is no necessity of this false accusation being made in connection with a criminal proceeding.247."

      "title": "Giving false Evidence: No false charge.—",
      "content": "The words \"falsely charges\" in this section cannot mean giving false evidence against the accused as a prosecution witness during the course of a trial. To \"falsely charge\" must refer to the criminal or initial accusation putting or seeking to put in motion the machinery of criminal investigation and not when seeking to prove the false charge by making deposition in support of the charge framed in that trial. The words \"falsely charges\" have to be read along with the expression \"institution of criminal proceedings\". The false charge must, therefore, be made initially to a person in authority or to someone who is in a position to get the offender punished by appropriate proceedings. In other words it must be embodied either in a complaint or in a report of a cognizable offence to the police-officer or to an officer having authority over the person against whom the allegations are made. Giving false evidence in course of a trial amounts to an offence under sections 193 and 195 and not under section 211, IPC, 1860.248."

The police made an inquiry and reported that there was no case of poisoning and the charge was struck off. One of the persons then brought a complaint under this section against the accused. It was held that the report to the police did not amount to a charge of a criminal offence.250."

False identification in a Test Identification Parade is not falsely charging.252.\n4. 'Knowing that there is no just or lawful ground'.—This expression is the equivalent of the English technical phrase \"without reasonable or probable cause,\" which means an honest belief in the guilt of the accused based upon a full conviction, founded upon reasonable grounds, of the existence of a state of circumstances, which, assuming them to be true, would reasonably lead any ordinarily prudent and cautious man, placed in the position of the accuser, to the conclusion that the person charged was probably guilty of the crime imputed. There must be:\nFirst, an honest belief of the accuser in the guilt of the accused;\n\nSecond, such belief must be based on an honest conviction of the existence of the circumstances which led the accuser to that conclusion;\nThird, such belief must be based upon reasonable grounds; that is, such grounds as would lead any fairly cautious man in the defendant's situation so to believe;\nFourth, the circumstances so believed and relied on by the accuser must be such as amount to reasonable ground for belief in the guilt of the accused.253.\nA person may, in good faith, institute a charge that is subsequently found to be false, or he may, with intent to cause injury to an enemy, institute criminal proceedings against him, believing there are good grounds for them but in neither case has he committed an offence under this section. To constitute this offence it must be shown that the person instituting criminal proceedings knew there was no just or lawful ground for such proceedings.254.\nIn the absence of any special circumstances to rebut it, the judgment of one competent tribunal against the complainant affords very strong evidence of reasonable and probable cause.255.\n5. 'If such criminal proceeding be instituted'.—There is a divergence of views between the Calcutta, the Madras and the Patna High Courts on the one hand, and the Allahabad and the Lahore High Courts on the other, on the question whether the latter part of the section applies to such cases of complaints to the police which are disposed of without a formal magisterial inquiry. A Full Bench of the Calcutta High Court has held that the latter part would apply to such cases where the charge related to the more serious offence.256. This case is followed by the Madras257. and the Patna258. High Courts. The test to apply is,—did the person who made the charge intend to set the criminal law in motion against the person on whom the charge is made.259.\n\nThe Allahabad High Court has, on the other hand, held that to constitute the offence defined in the second paragraph of this section, it is necessary that criminal proceedings should be instituted. Where the offence committed does not go further than the making of a false charge to the police, the making of such charge does not amount to institution of criminal proceedings, and the offence committed will fall within the first paragraph, notwithstanding that the offence so falsely charged may be one of those referred to in the second paragraph.260. The former Chief Court of the Punjab held likewise.261."

      "content": "A complaint alleging commission of an offence punishable under section 211 IPC, 1860, \"in or in relation to any proceedings in any Court\", is maintainable only at the instance of that Court or by an officer of that Court authorized in writing for that purpose or some other Court to which that Court is subordinate, is abundantly clear from the language employed in the provision.262. When the offence under section 211, IPC, 1860, is committed in relation to Court proceedings, cognizance without Court's complaint is barred by section 195 (1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973.263. Since an order of a Magistrate discharging an accused on submission of a police report under section 173, Cr PC, 1973, is a judicial and not administrative order, a complaint by the Magistrate or his superior Court under section 195(1)(b)(i), Cr PC, 1973, would be necessary to take cognizance of an offence under section 211, IPC, 1860.264. Similarly, remand and bail proceedings too have been held to be Court proceedings and as such a complaint by the Court would be necessary to take cognizance of the offence under section 211, IPC, 1860.265. This view of the law has now been affirmed by the Supreme Court as well.266."

It is only in second and third situation that section 195(1), Cr PC, 1973 would apply. The fact that proceedings had been concluded would not be material because section 195(1) does not require that proceedings in any Court must actually be pending at the time when the question of applying the bar arises if the offence under section 211, IPC, 1860 is alleged to have been committed in relation to those proceedings.267. A complaint by the concerned Executive Magistrate could be necessary under section 195(1)(a)(i), and there could be no sufficient reason for dispensing with the necessity for a complaint by him for prosecution of an offence under section 211, IPC, 1860 committed in relation to a proceeding before him under section 144, Cr PC, 1973.268."

Section 211 imposes a punishment in case of a false charge or offence made with the intent to injure someone before any Court of law, whereas section 500 provides for punishment in case of a defamation of a person by any one. Defamation has been defined under section 499 which provides inter alia whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person. Making a false complaint before a Court of law would amount to committing fraud on Court. It is for\n\nthe Court to proceed against the erring person. The provision has been made to preserve the sanctity of the Court. Section 500 gives right to sue to a person who is defamed within the meaning of section 499 by the conduct of the accused.

In relation to proceeding in any Court, the offences enumerated are: giving false evidence or fabricating false evidence (sections 191–193); giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction (sections 194 and 195); threatening any person to give false evidence (section 195A); using evidence known to be false (section 196); using as true a certificate known to be false (section 198); making a false statement in a declaration which is by law receivable as evidence (section 199); using as true any declaration receivable as evidence, knowing it to be false (section 200); causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender (section 201); intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform (section 202); giving false information in respect of an offence (section 203); destruction of document or electronic record to prevent its production as evidence (section 204); false personation (section 205); fraudulent removal/concealment of property (section 206); fraudulent claim to property (section 207); fraudulently suffering or obtaining decree for sum not due (section 208 and section 210); dishonestly making a false claim in Court (section 209); and intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceedings (section 228). Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no Court shall take cognizance of any offence punishable under section 172–188 (dealing with the contempt of the lawful authority of public servants) or section 193–196, 199, 200, 205–211 and 228, when such offence is alleged to have been committed in, or in relation to, any proceeding in any Court, except on the complaint in writing of that Court by such officer of the Court as that Court may authorise in writing in this behalf, or of some other Court to which that Court is subordinate.1."

    "section212.1": {
      "title": "Offender.—",
      "content": "The word used is 'offender' and not 'accused' or a person convicted for that offence. The person who is sheltering, harbouring or concealing that person must have knowledge or has reason to believe that he is the 'offender'. The word \"offender\" is not defined under IPC, 1860. \"Offender\" as per the Dictionary, means \"a person who has committed a crime or offence.\" Hence, a person who is convicted or acquitted may be an offender, for the purpose of section 212. An \"offender\" for the purpose of section 212 is neither a convict nor an accused, but he is a person who has actually committed the offence. The failure of the prosecution to prove the identity of the person who committed the offence does not render the person, who committed the offence, not an offender. He can be said to be an offender whose guilt has not been proved in Court. Yet, he is an offender, if he has committed an offence.281.\nThis section applies to the harbouring of persons who have actually committed some offence under the Penal Code or an offence under some special or local law, when the thing punishable under such special or local law is punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards. It does not apply to the harbouring of persons, not being criminals, who merely abscond to avoid or delay a judicial investigation.282. Where there was no material to show that the accused had the knowledge or that he reasonably believed that he was harbouring or concealing a person who was an\n\noffender and the essential feature of secrecy was totally absent, it was held that no offence under section 212 was made out.283. It is the knowledge or the reasonable belief of the accused under section.212 that the person whom, he has harboured or concealed to be the offender, which is relevant. But, such knowledge or belief must be entertained by the accused, on the date on which he commits the offence by harbouring or concealing him.284.\n\nIn the conspiracy for assassination of the former Prime Minister of India (Mr. Rajiv Gandhi), some of the accused persons appeared at the scene after achievement of the object. They played the role of harbouring and sheltering the main accused persons with full knowledge of their involvement in the assassination. They also made efforts to destroy evidence. Their conviction under section 212 was held to be proper.285."

No other relationship can excuse the wilful receipt or assistance of felons; a father cannot assist his child, a child his parent, a brother his brother, a master his servant, a servant his master."

This provision is mandatory unless there is a reasonable excuse for omission or failure to inform. Section 39 of the Code of Criminal Procedure specifically provides that public \"shall\" give information to the police or the nearest Magistrate regarding commission of certain offences referred to in the said section. Section 39 is only a procedural section, violation of which is not made punishable under any penal statute, but, if a person who has knowledge or reasonable belief that a person is the offender can be treated as a person who is aware of the commission of the offence and even if he is not punishable for violating section 39 of the Code of Criminal Procedure when he harbours or conceals such an offender, he must certainly be guilty for offence under section 212.286."

It would not be safe to convict the appellant for the offence punishable under section 216 IPC, 1860 in absence of evidence in this regard.308.\n\nThis section may be compared with section 212. The latter deals with the offence of harbouring an offender who having committed an offence absconds. This section deals with harbouring an offender who has escaped from custody after being actually convicted or charged with the offence, or whose apprehension has been ordered; the latter offence is in the eye of the law more aggravated, and a heavier punishment is, therefore, awarded for it. It is thus an aggravated form of the offence punishable under section 212.\nThe section only takes into consideration cases where the man who is harboured is wanted for an offence for which a maximum sentence of at least one year's imprisonment is provided. No provision is made for cases where he is wanted for offences for which the maximum sentence is less than one year.309. Where certain persons were apprehended for gaming and they escaped from police custody, it was held by the Supreme Court that this section was not applicable because they were neither charged nor convicted of any offence and that the conviction should have been under section 224.310.\n\n1.

It was held that he was properly charged with, and found guilty of, having\n\ncommitted an offence under this section.323. A report of the commission of a dacoity was made at a police station. The police-officer in charge of the station took down the report which was made to him, but subsequently destroyed the report and framed another and a false report of the commission of a totally different offence to which he obtained the signature of the complainant, and which he endeavoured to pass off as the original and correct report made to him by the complainant. It was held that the police-officer was guilty of offences punishable under sections 204 and 218.324.

Even assuming that such a check post officer could detain a person, still he could not be prosecuted as detention was not synonymous with confinement nor the persons escaping were charged or convicted of any offence.350.

It was held that he was not liable to be convicted under this section because he was not lawfully detained for any offence.355. It is only after a person has been arrested that the question of custody arises merely because the person was brought to the thana for the purpose of interrogation it could not be said that he was under lawful custody, even though two constables might be sitting by his side.356. Where certain persons were apprehended for gaming and they escaped from police custody, it was pointed out by the Supreme Court that they could have been convicted under this section.357. Where the accused attacked the police personnel and rescued a person from the legal custody of the police but the person rescued neither resisted the arrest nor joined in the attack, he could only be convicted under section 224 for taking advantage of his release.358.

The preceding section punishes the offenders themselves. Section 130 deals with rescuing a prisoner of State or war and section 186, with rescuing in any other case.\n'Rescue' is the act of forcibly freeing a person from custody against the will of those who have him in custody.366. It has no application to a person who is in lawful custody and who has offered no resistance or obstruction.367. It is also not necessary that the rescuing should be done intentionally for in the second part of this section the word \"intentionally\" has been deliberately omitted. Thus where a person even in order to pacify a situation released an accused from the lawful custody of the chowkidar by untying the turban with which the accused had been tied, it was held that the person so releasing the accused was clearly guilty of an offence under section 225, IPC, 1860, for rescuing an offender from lawful custody.368.\n\nOne can be held guilty for an offence under section 225 if he rescues a person who was detained lawfully. Here the word 'rescue' though not defined in the Code, will always mean an act of getting a person free forcibly from custody against the will of person in whose lawful custody he was. Therefore, some overt act needs to be there, if one is said to have rescued a person from the lawful custody.369.\nWhere the accused obstructed the lawful apprehension of a person and wrongfully confined two police personnel and the evidence of the prosecution was amply corroborated and supported by medical evidence, conviction and sentence of the accused under sections 225, 332 and 342 was upheld.370. The act for which the person rescued is detained must amount to an offence under the Code. Thus an escape from custody when being taken before a Magistrate for the purpose of being bound over to be of good behaviour,371. or an escape from arrest under section 41(2), Criminal Procedure Code,372. will not fall under this section. If the apprehension is not lawful the person resisting it will not be guilty of any offence.373.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

A presumption can also be drawn under Explanation 2 of section 28 that a person is counterfeiting coins when he causes one coin to resemble another so closely that the person intended to practice deception or knew it would be likely to cause deception. Section 232 prescribes the punishment for counterfeiting Indian coins. Section 235 prescribes the punishment for a person who is in possession of any instrument or material used for counterfeiting coins. Thus, a conviction under sections 232 or 235 would be maintained only if the prosecution satisfactorily proves the ingredients of section 28. The prosecution must establish that the coins manufactured resemble the original. It must also establish that there is an intention to deceive, or the knowledge that deception would be caused by such resemblance.13.\n'Counterfeiting' means causing one thing to resemble another.14.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.

It is the quantum of annoyance or discomfort in contra distinction to private nuisance which affects an individual is the decisive factor.1.\nNuisance is of two kinds: (1) public and (2) private.\n\n(1) Public nuisance or common nuisance is an offence against the public either by doing a thing, which tends to the annoyance of the whole community in general, or by neglecting to do anything that the common good requires. It is an act affecting the public at large, or some considerable portion of them and it must interfere with rights, which members of the community might otherwise enjoy.\nIt is not a sine qua non that the annoyance should injuriously affect every member of the public within its range of operation. It is sufficient that it should affect people in general who dwell in the vicinity.2.\nAs to when an individual can bring a civil action in respect of a public nuisance, see the authors' Law of Torts, 19th Edn, chapter XXI.\n(2) Private nuisance is defined to be anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements or hereditaments of another, and not amounting to trespass. It is an act affecting some particular individual or individuals as distinguished from the public at large. It is in the quantum of annoyance that private nuisance differs from public. It cannot be the subject of an indictment, but may be the ground of a civil action for damages or an injunction or both.3."

Where the owner of a grain pit sold the contents of it before it was opened at a certain sum per maund whether the grain was good or bad, and on the pit being opened it was found that a large proportion of the grain was unfit for human consumption, it was held that the vendor could not be convicted under this section.24. Similarly, the selling of wheat containing a large admixture of extraneous matter, such as dirt, wood, matches, charcoal, was held to constitute no offence.25.\nFor local amendments see comment under section 272 ante.\n\n\n\n\n\n23.

      "title": "Rash driving or riding on a public way.",
      "content": "Whoever drives any vehicle, or rides, on any public way in a manner so rash or negligent 1 as to endanger human life, 2 or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to six months, or with fine which may extend to one thousand rupees, or with both.\n\n\n\n2. Such driving or riding must be so rash or negligent as to endanger human life or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person.\n1. 'Rash or negligent'.—Rash and negligent driving has to be examined in light of the facts and circumstances of a given case. It is a fact incapable of being construed or seen in isolation. The preliminary conditions, thus, are that\n(a) it is the manner in which the vehicle is driven;\n\n(b) it be driven either rashly or negligently; and\n\n(c) such rash or negligent driving should be such as to endanger human life.30. The criminality lies in running the risk of doing such an act with recklessness and indifference to the consequences. The words \"rashly and negligently\" are distinguishable and one is exclusive of the other. The same act cannot be \"rash\" as well as \"negligent\".31. Where negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence, the negligence to be established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the negligence merely based upon an error of judgment. Simple lack of care such as will constitute civil liability, is not enough; for liability under the criminal law, a very high degree of negligence is required to be proved.32.\nThere is a distinction between a rash act and a negligent act. A reckless act has to be understood in two different senses—subjective and objective. In the subjective sense, it means deliberate or conscious taking of an unjustified risk, which could be easily foreseen and in the circumstances of the case was unreasonable to take. In the objective sense, the accused is not conscious of the result though he ought to be aware that it might follow and in this sense, it is almost equivalent to negligence. In other words, negligence involves blameworthy heedlessness on the part of the accused which a normal prudent man exercising reasonable care and caution ought to avoid. Negligence is an omission to do something, which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do. A culpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal consequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the belief that the actor has taken sufficient precaution to prevent their happening. Culpable negligence is acting without the consciousness, that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the caution incumbent upon him and if he had he would have had the consciousness. As between rashness and negligence, rashness is a graver offence.33. Negligence is not an absolute term but is a relative one; it is rather a comparative term. It is difficult to state with precision any mathematically exact formula by which negligence, or lack of it, can be infallibly measured in a given case. Whether there exists negligence per se or the course of conduct amounts to negligence will normally depend upon the attending and surrounding facts and circumstances which have to be taken into consideration by the Court. In a given case, even not doing what one was ought to do can constitute negligence.34. Absence of high speed itself cannot absolve the petitioner from the culpability.35.\nThere are several offences in the Code in which the element of criminal rashness or negligence occurs, viz.,—sections 279, 280, 283–289, 304A, 336, 337, 338.\n2. 'Endanger human life'.—It must be proved that the accused was driving the vehicle on a public way in a manner which endangered human life or was likely to cause hurt or injury to any other person.36. It is not necessary that the rash or negligent act should result in injury to life or property.37."

    "section279.2": {
      "title": "Reasonable care.—",
      "content": "The Court has to adopt another parameter, i.e., 'reasonable care' in determining the question of negligence or contributory negligence. The doctrine of reasonable care imposes an obligation or a duty upon a person (for e.g., a driver) to care for the pedestrian on the road and this duty attains a higher degree when the pedestrian happen to be children of tender years. It is axiomatic to say that while driving a vehicle on a public way, there is an implicit duty cast on the drivers to see that their driving does not endanger the life of the right users of the road, may be either vehicular users or pedestrians. They are expected to take sufficient care to avoid danger to others.38."

      "title": "Res ipsa Loquitur.—",
      "content": "This doctrine serves two purposes–one that an accident may by its nature be more consistent with its being caused by negligence for which the opposite party is responsible than by any other causes and that in such a case, the mere fact of the accident is prima facie evidence of such negligence. Second, to avoid hardship in cases where the claimant is able to prove the accident but cannot prove how the accident occurred. The Courts have also applied the principle of res ipsa loquitur in cases where no direct evidence was brought on record. Elements of this doctrine may be stated as:\n(a) The event would not have occurred but for someone's negligence.\n\n(b) The evidence on record rules out the possibility that actions of the victim or some third party could be the reason behind the event.\n(c) Accused was negligent and owed a duty of care towards the victim.40. The principle of res ipsa loquitur is only a rule of evidence to determine the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence.41. This doctrine operates in the domain of civil law especially in the cases of torts and helps in determining the onus of proof in actions relating to negligence. It cannot be pressed 'in service for determining per se the liability for negligence within the domain of criminal law. Res ipsa loquitur has, if at all, a limited application in trial on a charge of criminal negligence.42. Where a vehicle was being driven on a wrong side, accident resulting in the death of two persons, the principle of res ipsa loquitur should have been applied.43. In the case of Thakur Singh v State of Punjab,44. the accused drove a bus rashly and negligently with 41 passengers and while crossing a bridge, the bus fell into the nearby canal resulting in death of all the passengers. The Court applied the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur since admittedly the petitioner was driving the bus at the relevant time and it was going over the bridge when it fell down."

Failure to apply brakes at relevant time does not by itself constitute rash and negligent act for it may as well be due to error of judgment.51. A vehicle of which handbrake and speedometer were not in working order is a very serious hazard to the public as the driver would never know his speed. It is a danger to the traffic in general.52."

      "content": "In a case the allegation was that the accused, car driver, drove car in a rash and negligent manner and caused injury to a child who was playing on side of road. But the evidence showed that vehicle was going in middle of road and child was also playing on road. Brake skid marks on road were duly depicted in site plan, acquittal was held proper by the High Court.55. Where a tractor driver was driving the tractor at a speed of six miles per hour at night and a man who was sitting on it in a careless fashion unmindful of bumps and jolts fell down and died, it was held that the driver was not guilty of any rash or negligent act within the meaning of sections 279 and 304A, IPC, 1860.56. Where a truck dashed against a cyclist and a cart resulting in injuries to both the cyclist and the cartman but there was no evidence to the actual dashing of the\n\ntruck against the cyclist and the cart and no evidence was either available about the mechanical fitness or otherwise of the truck as the same had been set on fire by an angry mob, it could not be presumed that the truck must have been driven rashly and negligently merely because two persons were injured. In the circumstances, the conviction of the accused under sections 279 and 304A, IPC, 1860 was set aside.57. Merely because the driver ran away from the spot immediately after the incident, it could not be said that he must have been driving rashly and negligently.58. Driving at a high speed or non-sounding of horn by itself does not mean that the driver is rash or negligent. Place, time, traffic and crowd are important factors to determine rashness or negligence.59. High speed at a crowded road and pressing a person against a wall in order to save accident was held to be negligence within the meaning of this section.60. To drive at a high speed on an empty road or at a lonely place is not the same thing as driving in a crowded city street.61. Crushing a school child while driving past a school was held to be ipso facto rashness. Everybody is expected to slow down and take extra precautions near the vicinity of an educational institution.62. The mere fact that there are more than two persons in a two-wheeled vehicle will not make out an offence under section 279, IPC, 1860 as it by itself does not amount to so rash and negligent an act as to endanger human life, section 279, IPC, 1860 is not attracted where the driving is ordinarily rash or negligent. Moreover, if an offence is really made out, then driver alone is responsible and not the pillion rider or riders. Therefore, the police practice of apprehending all occupants of the vehicle is deprecated.63."

Where the accused, bus driver when attempted to overtake a lorry, on seeing one other bus coming in opposite direction swerved the bus towards the left and came in a violent contact with the victim, a cyclist, the Madras High Court held that the very act of the accused in driving the bus and dashing from behind the cyclist clearly constitutes the rashness and negligence on his part.67."

      "content": "One of the most effective ways of keeping drivers under mental vigil is to maintain a deterrent element in the sentencing sphere. Any latitude shown to them in that sphere would tempt them to make driving frivolous and a frolic.71. For lessening the high rate of motor accidents due to careless and callous driving of vehicles, the Courts are expected to consider all the relevant facts and circumstances bearing on the question of sentence and proceed to impose a sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence if the prosecution is able to establish the guilt beyond reasonable doubt.72. Where the accused dashed the jeep against a tree, as a result of which one person, who was travelling in the jeep got injured and died, and another person, who was also in the same vehicle received injuries, the Supreme Court held that the High Court, without proper appreciation of the evidence and consideration of the gravity of the offence, showed undue sympathy by reducing the sentence.73."

However, in another case, Madras High Court held that simply because accused are found guilty under section 304-A IPC, 1860 and sentence is imposed, there is no embargo for Court to impose separate sentence under section 279 IPC, 1860.75.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30.

By Act 36 of 1969, section 292 was amended to give more precise meaning to the word 'obscene' as used in the section in addition to creating an exception for publication of matter which is proved to be justified as being for the public good, being in the interest of science, literature, art or learning or other objects of general concern. Prior to its amendment, section 292 contained no definition of obscenity. The amendment also literally does not provide for a definition of 'obscenity' in as much as it introduces a deeming provision.108. In order to make the law relating to the publication of obscene matters or objects deterrent, the section provides for enhanced punishment. The Exception to the original section, which is now redrafted, exempts from the provisions of the section any representation, sculptured, engraved or painted on or in any ancient monument. The possession referred to in this section connotes conscious possession.109. By Act 25 of 1960, the State of Tamil Nadu has added a new section as section 292A for dealing with printing, of grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for blackmail. The State of Orissa has followed suit by Act 13 of 1962. The intention of the Legislature while amending the provision is to deal with this type of offences which corrupt the mind of the people to whom objectionable things can easily reach and need not be emphasized that corrupting influence is more likely to be upon the younger generation who has got to be protected from being easy prey.110. This section was amended by Act XXXVI when apart from enlarging the scope of the exceptions, the penalty was enhanced which was earlier up to three months or with fine or with both. By the amendment a dichotomy of penal treatment was introduced for dealing with the first offenders and the subsequent offenders. In the case of even a first conviction, the accused shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and with fine which may extend to Rs 2,000.111.\n\n1. 'Obscene'.—The word obscenity is not defined in the IPC, 1860. The word 'obscene' was originally used to describe anything disgusting, repulsive, filthy or foul. The use of the word is now said to be somewhat archaic or poetic; and it is ordinarily restricted to something offensive to modesty or decency, or expressing or suggesting unchaste or lustful ideas, or being impure, indecent, or lewd.112. The obscene matter in a book must be considered by itself and separately to find out whether it is so gross and its obscenity, so decided, that it is likely to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to influences of this sort and into whose hands the book is likely to fall. In this connection, the interests of our contemporary society and particularly the influence of the book on it must not be overlooked.113. It was further observed in this case that\n\nmerely treating with sex and nudity in art and literature cannot be regarded as evidence of obscenity without something more. It was held that where obscenity and art are mixed, art must be so preponderating as to throw the obscenity into the shadow or the obscenity so trivial and insignificant that it can have no effect and may be overlooked. When treatment of sex becomes offensive to public decency and morality as judged by the prevailing standards of morality in the society, then only the work may be regarded as an obscene production.114. In considering the question of obscenity of a publication what the Court has to see is that whether a class, not an isolated case, into whose hands the book, article or story falls suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved by reading it or might have impure and lecherous thoughts aroused in their minds.115. It was also observed in this case that the question of obscenity may have to be judged in the light of the claim that the work has a predominant literary merit. Referring to the impact on the mind of the youth, the Court said:116.\n\nWe do not think that it can be said with any assurance that merely because the adolescent youth read situations of the type presented in the book, they would become deprived, debased and encouraged to lasciviousness. It is possible that they may come across such situations in life and may have to face them. But if a narration or description of a similar situation is given in a setting emphasising a strong moral to be drawn from it and condemns the conduct of the erring party as wrong and loathsome, it cannot be said that they have a likelihood of corrupting the morals of, those in whose hands it is likely to fall—particularly the adolescent.\n\nIn KA Abbas v UOI,117. the Supreme Court has called the test laid down in Mishkin's case118. as 'selective audience obscenity test' and observed as:\nour standards must be so framed that we are not reduced to a level where the protection of the least capable and the most depraved amongst us determines what the morally healthy cannot view or read ….\nThe requirements of art and literature include within themselves a comprehensive view of social life and not only in its ideal form and the line is to be drawn where the average moral man begins to feel embarrassed or disgusted at a naked portrayal of life without the redeeming touch of art or genius or social value. If the depraved begins to see in these things more than what an average person would, in much the same way, as it is wrongly said, a Frenchman sees a woman's legs in everything, it cannot be helped. In our scheme of things ideas having redeeming social or artistic value must also have importance and protection for their growth.\n\nIn the case of Samaresh Bose v Amal Mitra119. wherein the Supreme Court provided the following guidance:120.\nIn our opinion, in judging the question of obscenity, the judge in the first place should try to place himself in the position of the author and from the view point of the author the judge should try to understand what is it that the author seeks to convey and what the author conveys has any literary and artistic value. The judge should thereafter place himself in the position of a reader of every age group in whose hands the book is likely to fall and should try to appreciate what kind of possible influence the book is likely to have in the minds of the readers. The judge should thereafter apply his judicial mind dispassionately to decide whether the book in question can be said to be obscene within the meaning of the section by an objective assessment of the book as a whole and also of the passages complained of as obscene separately.\n\nIt is no defence to a charge of obscenity merely to urge that the information has been copied from similar works.121.\nIn Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin, Promilla Kapur (Dr) v Yash Pal Bhasin,122. the Delhi High Court felt123. that there was nothing wrong if a sociologist made a research on the subject of call-girls in order to know the reasons as to why and how the young girls fall in this profession and what society could do in order to eradicate or at least minimise the possibility of young budding girls joining the flesh trade. The book was in the form of interviews with the girls in the profession. The portion marked by the Magistrate as obscene was a description of their encounters with unscrupulous males\n\nincluding a description by some girls of their first experience with sex. But by far the bulk of the book dealt with the ways and means of running the profession and the methods of encountering them. Thus, the book was within the scope of clause (a) of the first exception. In Bobby Art International v Om Pal Singh Hoon,124. while examining the validity of certificate of exhibition awarded to the film \"Bandit Queen\" it was held that nakedness does not always arouse the baser instinct. In Director General, Directorate General of Doordarshan v Anand Patwardhan,125. the Supreme Court again referred to the Hicklin test and observed that the relevant questions are:\n\n(a) whether the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole appeal to the prurient interest.\n(b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically, defined by the applicable state law,\n(c) whether the work taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.\nIn the case of Ajay Goswami v UOI,126. the Supreme Court, while recognizing the right of adult entertainment, reviewed the position of law on obscenity and summarized the various tests laid down regarding obscenity."

      "content": "Unless the picture of a nude/semi-nude female is an incentive to sensuality or impure or excite the thoughts in the mind of an ordinary person of normal temperament, the pictures cannot be regarded as obscene within the meaning of section 292 IPC, 1860. But where repetitive photographs without any backdrop content are published in a magazine and nearly l/4th of the magazine consists of nothing but repetitive photographs of semi-nude women, prominence being to display their breast, there being hardly any literary contents in the magazine, the matter loses any literary content and therefore the broad social outlook penned in Ranjit Udeshi's case127. may not be available as a defence.128. To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292 and 294 IPC, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme end of the spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisfied only when the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person having perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and debase persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art.129."

The other test is Community Standard Test, whereby the obscenity has to be judged from the point of view of an average person, by applying contemporary community standards. In Aveek Sarkar v State of WB,131. the Supreme Court was of the view that Hicklin test is not the correct test to be applied to determine \"what is obscenity\".\n\nWhen the name of Mahatma Gandhi is alluded or used as a symbol, speaking or using obscene words, the concept of \"degree\" comes in. To elaborate, the \"contemporary\n\ncommunity standards test\" becomes applicable with more vigour, in a greater degree and in an accentuated manner.132."

In the absence of any such certificate, the petitioners cannot claim immunity from prosecution under section 292 of the IPC.135. In GP Lamba v Tarun Mehta,136. explaining the role of the Censor Board certificate,137. the Court said:\nThe law presumes the regular performance of official acts. This is not to suggest that the grant of a certificate debars the court from judging the obscenity of a film  or that the\ncertificate is conclusive.... such a certificate is the opinion of a high powered Board especially entrusted with power to screen off the silver screen pictures which offensively invade or deprave public morale through over-sex The rebuttable presumption, which\narises in favour of the statutory certificate, can be negatived by positive evidence.

In Samaresh Base's case149. the Supreme Court of India considered the evidence of two eminent Bengali novelists to determine whether the book 'Prajapati', a Bengali novel, has a tendency to deprave and corrupt youth, who are likely to read it and having regard to their evidence decided the case in favour of the accused. It was however held that, though a Court of law may consider the views of reputed authors or leading literatures, the ultimate duty to make a proper assessment regarding obscenity or otherwise of a book rests only with the Court.150. The prosecution need not prove something which the law does not burden it with. As regards the second part of the guilty act (actus reus), i.e. the selling or keeping for sale an object which is found to be obscene, here of course the ordinary mens rea is required to be shown before the offence can be said to be complete. Even so, it was\n\nheld in this case that in criminal prosecution mens rea must necessarily be proved by circumstantial evidence alone unless the accused confesses. Thus, it is not required that prosecution must prove guilty intention to possess or possess for sale, by positive evidence. The Court will presume that the owner of the shop is guilty if the book is sold on his behalf and later found to be obscene unless he can establish that the sale was without his knowledge or consent. Thus to escape liability he has to prove his lack of knowledge.151. In India, it is also a defence to plead a certificate given by the Board of Censors. Thus, a certificate granted by the Board of Censors under section 5A of the Cinematograph Act 1952, certifying a film to be fit for public exhibition, circulation or distribution would by virtue of section 79, IPC, 1860, make prosecution under section 292, IPC, unsustainable even if the film be obscene, lascivious or tending to deprave or corrupt public morale. This is so as section 79, IPC, (justification on ground of bona fide mistake of fact) is exculpatory when read with section 5A of the Cinematograph Act and the certificate issued thereunder.152."

When the Act in various provisions deals with obscenity in electronic form, it covers the offence under section 292 IPC, 1860.

Act No. 25 of 1960, s. 4 (w.e.f. 9-11-1960).\nIn its application to the whole of the State of Tamil Nadu, in Section 293,—\n\nAmendment of section 293, Central Act XLV of 1860.—In section 293 of the said Code—\n\n(i) for the words 'any such obscene object as is referred to in the last preceding section', the words, figures and letter \"any such obscene object as is referred to in Section 292 or any such newspaper, periodical, circular, picture or other printed or written document as is referred to in Section 292A\", shall be substituted;\n(ii) for the words 'which may extend to six months', the words 'which may extend to three years\" shall be substituted; and\n(iii) in the marginal note, after the words \"obscene objects\" the words \"and grossly indecent or scurrilous matter or matter intended for blackmail\", shall be inserted.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section provides for enhanced sentence where the obscene objects are sold, to persons under the age of 20 years. By Act 36 of 1969 the punishment for the offence is further enhanced. On going through section 293, it is clear that a separate penal provision was made with regard to the sale, exhibition, of such obscene object to any person under the age of 20 years where as section 292 (1) deals with sale, exhibition, of such obscene object to any person. Therefore, in order to make the provision more stringent and grave insofar as it relates to the sale, of obscene objects to younger persons–aged less than 20 years, a separate penal provision, made applicable in section 293, was introduced. It is in that context, the word 'obscene' occurring in section 292(1) is made applicable to section 293 also.158. In a trial for the offences under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC, 1860, a certificate granted under section 6 of the Cinematograph Act by the Board of Censors does not provide an irrebuttable defence to accused who have been granted such a certificate, but it is certainly a relevant fact of some weight to be taken into consideration by the criminal Court in deciding whether the offence charged is established. The Court must have regard to the fact that the certificate represents the judgment of a body of persons particularly selected under the statute for the specific purpose of adjudging the suitability of films for public exhibition, and that judgment extends to a consideration of the principal ingredients which go to constitute the offences under sections 292 and 293 of the IPC, 1860. At the same time, the Court must remind itself that the function of deciding whether the ingredients are established is primarily and essentially its own function, and it cannot abdicate that function in favour of another, no matter how august and qualified be the statutory authority.159."

Act likely to spread infection (sections 269–271).\n2. Adulteration of food or drink (sections 272–273).\n3. Adulteration of drugs (sections 274–276).\n4.

To fall within the scope of 'obscene' under sections 292 and 294 IPC, 1860, the ingredients of the impugned matter/art must lie at the extreme end of the spectrum of the offensive matter. The legal test of obscenity is satisfied only when the impugned art/matter can be said to appeal to an unhealthy, inordinate person having perverted interest in sexual matters or having a tendency to morally corrupt and debase persons likely to come in contact with the impugned art. It must also be remembered that a piece of art may be vulgar but not obscene. In order to arrive at a dispassionate conclusion where it is crucial to understand that art from the perspective of the painter, it is also important to picture the same from a spectator's point of view who is likely to see it.164. The obscene act or song must cause annoyance. Though annoyance is an important ingredient of this offence, it being associated with mental condition, has often to be inferred from proved facts. Thus, where a Doctor was filthily abused in a public place by dragging the name of his wife and he and some members of the public were impelled to complain to the police, it was held that there was sufficient indication of the fact that they were all annoyed even though it was not stated or spoken to by them in their evidence.165."

Subsequently in the year 2006, the said painting entitled 'Bharat Mata' was advertised as part of an online auction for charity for Kashmir earthquake victims organised by a non-governmental organisation with which the petitioner claimed to have no involvement. It was stated that the petitioner at no point in time had given a title to the said painting. There can be no exasperation caused by viewing such painting on the website for the reason that a person would first access such a website only if he has some interest in art and that too contemporary art, and in case he does view such a website, he always would have the option to not to view or close the said web page. It appeared that the complainants are not the types who would go to art galleries or have an interest in contemporary art, because if they did, they would know that there are many other artists who embrace nudity as part of their contemporary art. Hence, the offence alleged under section 294 IPC, 1860, could not be made out.170."

It was held that cabaret dances where indecent and obscene act per se is involved would not attract the provision of section 294 of the IPC without fulfilment of its essential ingredients, i.e. Evidence pertaining to \"annoyance to others\". In State of Maharashtra v Indian Hotel & Restaurants Association,172. the Supreme Court lifted the ban on dance bars holding that \"we fail to see how exactly the same dances can be said to be morally acceptable in the exempted establishments and lead to depravity if performed in the prohibited establishments. Rather it is evident that the same dancer can perform the same dance in the high-class hotels, clubs, and gymkhanas but is prohibited of doing so in the establishments covered under section 33A of Bombay Police Act, 1951. We see no rationale which would justify the conclusion that a dance that leads to depravity in one place would get converted to an acceptable performance by a mere change of venue\"."

G.O. Ms. No. 732, dated 5 December 1991.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section was brought into IPC, 1860 by the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1927 (25 of 1927) following the wide spread agitations erupting from the decision in Rajpaul v Emperor,15. commonly called as \"Rangila Rasul's case\", rendered by the Lahore High Court. Interpreting section 153A of IPC, 1860, which alone was there in the Statute then, it was held that no offence would lie thereunder however indecent be the comments made against a deceased religious leader. In fact a few months before Rangila Rasul's case was decided by the Lahore High Court, a totally dissenting view over the application of section 153A of IPC, 1860 had been rendered by the Allahabad High Court in Kali Charan Sharma v Emperor,16. holding that scurrilous and bad taste remarks against a religion or its founder promoting ill feelings between sects of different faith could be proceeded under section 153A of IPC, 1860. It was at that stage; the Legislature stepped in and brought in a new penal provision under section 295A in IPC, 1860. Section 295A of IPC, 1860 does not penalise every act of insult but penalises only deliberate acts of insult, so that even if by any expression insult is in fact caused, that expression is not an offence if the insult offered is unwilling or unintended.17. In order to attract the mischief of the provision of section 295A, the following ingredients are to be satisfied, viz., a person (1) by written words (2) with deliberate and malicious intention (3) of outraging the religious feelings (4) of any class of citizens of India, (5) insults or attempts to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of that class. In other words, (1) the intention has to be deliberate and malicious both and (2) for outraging the religious feelings (3) of a class of citizens of India (4) in order to insult or attempt to insult the religious or religious belief of that class, i.e., in India (5) by written words.18. Insults to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any deliberate or malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of that\n\nclass do not come within the section. It only punishes the aggravated form of insult to religion when it is perpetrated with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of that class.19.\nThe essence of the offence under this section is that the insult to religion or the outrage to religious feelings must be the sole, or primary, or at least the deliberate and conscious intention. In order to bring the case within this section it is not so much the matter of discourse as the manner of it. The words used should be such as are bound to be regarded by any reasonable man as grossly offensive and provocative and maliciously and deliberately intended to outrage the feeling of any class of citizens of India. It is no defence to a charge under this section for anyone to plead that he was writing a book in reply to the one written by one professing another religion who has attacked his own religion.20. In order to establish malice as contemplated by this section, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that, the applicant bore ill will or enmity against specific persons. If the injurious act was done voluntarily without a lawful excuse, malice may be presumed.21. Malice is often not capable of direct and tangible proof and in almost all cases has to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances having regard to the setting, background and connected facts in relation to the offending article.22. The truth of the allegation is not a good defence to a charge under this section.23.\nThe Supreme Court, while quashing a complaint observed that section 295A does not stipulate everything to be penalised and any and every act would tantamount to insult or attempt to insult the religion or the religious beliefs of class of citizens. It penalises only those acts of insults to or those varieties of attempts to insult the religion or religious belief of a class of citizens which are perpetrated with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of that class of citizens. Insults to religion offered unwittingly or carelessly or without any deliberate or malicious intention to outrage the religious feelings of that class do not come within the section. Further the said provision only punishes the aggravated form of insult to religion when it is perpetrated with the deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of that class.24."

It extends the principle laid down in section 295 to places which are treated as sacred. The essence of the section is an intention, or knowledge of likelihood, to wound feelings or insult religion and when with that intention or knowledge trespass on a place of sepulchre, indignity to a corpse, or disturbance to persons assembled for funeral ceremonies is committed, the offence is complete.39.\n1. 'Trespass in any place of worship'.—'Trespass' here implies not only criminal trespass but also an ordinary act of trespass, i.e., an entry on another's land without lawful authority with the intention specified in section 441.40. The term 'trespass' means any violent or injurious act, committed in such place and with such knowledge or intention as is defined in this section.41.\nThe trespass must be in a place of worship with the knowledge that the religious feelings of persons would be wounded thereby. Where some persons had sexual connection inside a mosque, it was held that they were guilty of an offence under this section.42.\n2. 'Funeral rites'.—The section contemplates disturbance of persons engaged in performing funeral ceremonies. But a moharram procession is not a funeral ceremony within the meaning of this section.43. Obstruction to the performance of obsequies comes under this section.44.\n3. Indignity to corpse.—What is indignity to corpse is not defined anywhere. Indignity is generally synonymous to humiliation or disgrace. A conduct to be criminal in the sense\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

We do not conceive that any person can be justified in wounding with deliberate intention the religious feelings of his neighbours by words, gestures or exhibitions.

Z believing the ground to be firm, treads on it, falls in and is killed. A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.\n\n(b) A knows Z to be behind a bush. B does not know it. A, intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely to cause Z's death, induces B to fire at the bush. B fires and kills Z. Here B may be guilty of no offence; but A has committed the offence of culpable homicide.\n\n(c) A, by shooting at a fowl with intent to kill and steal it, kills B, who is behind a bush; A not knowing that he was there. Here, although A was doing an unlawful act, he was not guilty of culpable homicide, as he did not intend to kill B, or to cause death by doing an act that he knew was likely to cause death.\nExplanation 1.—A person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disorder, disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other, shall be deemed to have caused his death.\nExplanation 2.—Where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such bodily injury shall be deemed to have caused the death, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment the death might have been prevented.\nExplanation 3.—The causing of the death of child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it may amount to culpable homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born.\n\n\n\n(B) Unlawful homicide includes—\n\n(1) Culpable homicide not amounting to murder (section 299).\n(2) Murder (section 300).\n(3) Rash or negligent homicide (section 304A).\n(4) Suicide (sections 305, 306).\n\n(A) Lawful or simple homicide.—This is committed where death is caused in one of the following ways:—\n\n1. Where death is caused by accident or misfortune, and without any criminal intention or knowledge in the doing of a lawful act, in a lawful manner, by lawful means, and with proper care and caution (section 80).\n2. Where death is caused justifiably, that is to say,\n(i) By a person, who is bound, or by mistake of fact in good faith believes himself bound, by law (section 76).\n(ii) By a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law (section 77).\n(iii) By a person acting in pursuance of the judgment or order of a Court of Justice (section 78).\n(iv) By a person who is justified or who by reason of a mistake of fact, in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law (section 79).\n(v) By a person acting without any criminal intention to cause harm and in good faith, for the purpose of preventing or avoiding other harm to person or property (section 81).\n(vi) Where death is caused in the exercise of the right of private defence of person or property (sections 100, 103).\n3. Where death is caused by a child, or a person of unsound mind, or an intoxicated person as will come under sections 82, 83, 84 and 85.\n4. Where death is caused unintentionally by an act done in good faith for the benefit of the person killed, when—\n(i) he or, if a minor or lunatic, his guardian, has expressly or impliedly consented to such an act (sections 87, 88); or\n(ii) where it is impossible for the person killed to signify his consent or where he is incapable of giving consent, and has no guardian from whom it is possible to obtain consent, in time for the thing to be done with benefit (section 92).\n(B) Unlawful homicide.—Culpable homicide is the first kind of unlawful homicide. It is the causing of death by doing:\n\n(i) an act with the intention of causing death;\n(ii) an act with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or\n(iii) an act with the knowledge that it was likely to cause death.\n\nWithout one or other of those elements, an act, though it may be in its nature criminal and may occasion death, will not amount to the offence of culpable homicide.1.\nCulpable homicide may be classified in three categories—(1) in which death is caused by the doing of an act with the intention of causing death; (2) when it is committed by causing death with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; and (3) where the death is caused by an act done with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death. Knowledge and intention should not be confused. Section 299 in defining first two categories does not deal with the knowledge whereas it does in relation to the third category. It would also be relevant to bear in mind the import of the terms \"likely by such act to cause death\". Herein again lies a distinction as \"likely\" would mean probably and not possibly. When an intended injury is likely to cause death, the same would mean an injury which is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death which in turn would mean that death will be the most probable result.2."

      "content": "If the death is caused under circumstances specified in section 80, the person causing the death will be exonerated under that section. But, if it is caused in doing an unlawful act, the question arises whether he should be punished for causing it. The Code says that when a person engaged in the commission of an offence causes death by pure accident, he shall suffer only the punishment of his offence, without any addition on account of such accidental death. See Illustration (c) to this section. The offence of culpable homicide supposes an intention, or knowledge of likelihood of causing death. In the absence of such intention or knowledge, the offence committed may be grievous hurt,16. or simple hurt.17. It is only where death is attributed to an injury which the offender did not know would endanger life or would be likely to cause death and which in normal conditions would not do so notwithstanding death being caused, that the offence will not be culpable homicide but grievous or simple hurt. Every such case depends upon the existence of abnormal conditions unknown to the person who\n\ninflicts the injury.18. A person who voluntarily inflicts injury such as to endanger life must always, except in the most extraordinary and exceptional circumstances, be taken to know that he is likely to cause death. If the victim is actually killed, the conviction in such cases ought ordinarily to be of the offence of culpable homicide.19. Once it is established that an act was a deliberate act and was not the result of accident or rashness or negligence, it is obvious that the offence would be culpable homicide.20."

The reason for this provision is obvious that it is not always that proper remedies and skilful treatment are within the reach of a wounded man.24.\nAlthough proof be given that the wound or other bodily injury if skilfully treated might not have resulted in death, yet, if in fact death is the result, the wound 'causes' death. And it does not avail the offender to prove that the first cause might have been removed or rendered inoperative by the application of proper remedies and that death might have been prevented. 'Proper remedies and skilful treatment' may not be within the reach of the wounded man; or if they are at hand, he may be unable or unwilling to resort to them. But this is immaterial so far as it relates to the due interpretation of the words 'cause of death'. The primary cause which sets in motion some other cause,—as the severe wound which induces gangrene or fever, and the ultimate effect, death, are sufficiently connected as cause and effect, notwithstanding that the supervening sickness or disease might have been cured by medical skill. All that it is essential to establish is that the death has been caused by the bodily injury and, if there be any intervening cause, that it is connected with a sufficient degree of probability with the primary one.25.\n\nIf death results from an injury voluntarily caused, the person who causes that injury is deemed to have caused death although the life of the victim might have been saved if proper medical attention had been given, and even if medical treatment was given but\n\nwas not the proper treatment, provided that it was administered in good faith by a competent physician or surgeon.26."

Z dies in consequence. A commits murder.\n\n(b) A, knowing that Z is labouring under such a disease that a blow is likely to cause his death, strikes him with the intention of causing bodily injury. Z dies in consequence of the blow. A is guilty of murder, although the blow might not have been sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of a person in a sound state of health. But if A, not knowing that Z is labouring under any disease, gives him such a blow as would not in the ordinary course of nature kill a person in a sound state of health, here A, although he may intend to cause bodily injury, is not guilty of murder, if he did not intend to cause death, or such bodily injury as in the ordinary course of nature would cause death.\n\n(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the ordinary course of nature. Z dies in consequence. Here, A is guilty of murder, although he may not have intended to cause Z's death.\n\n(d) A without any excuse fires a loaded cannon into a crowd of persons and kills one of them. A is guilty of murder, although he may not have had a premeditated design to kill any particular individual.\n\nWhen culpable homicide is not murder.\n\nException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident. The above exception is subject to the following provisos:—\n\nFirst.—That the provocation is not sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse for killing or doing harm to any person.\nSecondly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in obedience to the law, or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of the powers of such public servant.\nThirdly.—That the provocation is not given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\nExplanation.—Whether the provocation was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder is a question of fact.\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A, under the influence of passion excited by a provocation given by Z, intentionally kills Y, Z's child. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was not given by the child, and the death of the child was not caused by accident or misfortune in doing an act caused by the provocation.\n\n(b) Y gives grave and sudden provocation to A. A, on this provocation, fires a pistol at Y, neither intending nor knowing himself to be likely to kill Z, who is near him, but out of sight. A kills Z. Here A has not committed murder, but merely culpable homicide.\n\n(c) A is lawfully arrested by Z, a bailiff. A is excited to sudden and violent passion by the arrest, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done by a public servant in the exercise of his powers.\n\n(d) A appears as witness before Z, a Magistrate, Z says that he does not believe a word of A's deposition, and that A has perjured himself. A is moved to sudden passion by these words, and kills Z. This is murder.\n\n(e) A attempts to pull Z's nose, Z, in the exercise of the right of private defence, lays hold of A to prevent him from doing so. A is moved to sudden and violent passion in consequence, and kills Z. This is murder, in as much as the provocation was given by a thing done in the exercise of the right of private defence.\n\n(f) Z strikes B. B is by this provocation excited to violent rage. A, a bystander, intending to take advantage of B's rage, and to cause him to kill Z, puts a knife into B's hand for that purpose. B kills Z with the knife. Here B may have committed only culpable homicide, but A is guilty of murder.\nException 2.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds the power given to him by law and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence without premeditation, and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nZ attempts to horsewhip A, not in such a manner as to cause grievous hurt to A. A draws out a pistol. Z persists in the assault. A believing in good faith that he\n\ncan by no other means prevent himself from being horsewhipped, shoots Z dead. A has not committed murder, but only culpable homicide.\nException 3.—Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, being a public servant or aiding a public servant acting for the advancement of public justice, exceeds the powers given to him by law, and causes death by doing an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty as such public servant and without ill-will towards the person whose death is caused.\nException 4.—Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nExplanation.—It is immaterial in such cases which party offers the provocation or commits the first assault.\nException 5.—Culpable homicide is not murder when the person whose death is caused, being above the age of eighteen years, suffers death or takes the risk of death with his own consent.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA, by instigation, voluntarily causes, Z, a person under eighteen years of age, to commit suicide. Here, on account of Z's youth, he was incapable of giving consent to his own death; A has therefore abetted murder.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nIn this section, the definition of culpable homicide appears in an expanded form. Each of the four clauses requires that the act which causes death should be done intentionally, or with the knowledge or means of knowing that death is a natural consequence of the act. An intention to kill is not always necessary to make out a case of murder. A knowledge that the natural and probable consequence of an act would be death will suffice for a conviction under section 302, IPC, 1860.31."

      "title": "Culpable homicide and murder distinguished.—",
      "content": "The distinction between these two offences is very ably set forth by Melvill, J, in\nGovinda's case32. and by Sarkaria, J, in Punnayya's case.33. Since the decision of the\n\nSupreme Court is the law of the land by virtue of Article 141 of the Constitution, relevant passages from Punnayya's case are reproduced below for the guidance of all concerned.\nIn the scheme of the Penal Code, 'culpable homicide' is genus and 'murder' its specie. All 'murder' is 'culpable homicide' but not vice versa. Speaking generally 'culpable homicide sans 'special characteristics of murder' is culpable homicide not amounting to murder'. For the purpose of fixing punishment, proportionate to the gravity of this generic offence, the Code practically recognises three degrees of culpable homicide. The first is, what may be called, culpable homicide of the first degree. This is the gravest form of culpable homicide which is defined in s. 300 as 'murder'. The second may be termed as 'culpable homicide of the second degree'. This is punishable under the 1st part ofs. 304. Then, there is 'culpable homicide of the third degree'. This is the lowest type of culpable homicide and the punishment provided for it is also the lowest among the punishments provided for the three grades. Culpable homicide of this degree is punishable under the Second Part of s. 304.\n\nThe academic distinction between 'murder' and 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' has vexed the Courts for more than a century. The confusion is caused, if Courts losing sight of the true scope and meaning of the terms used by the legislature in these sections allow themselves to be drawn into minute abstractions. The safest way of approach to the interpretation and application of these provisions seems to be keeping in focus the key words used in the various clauses of sections 299 and 300. The following comparative table will be helpful in appreciating the points of distinction between the two offences.\n\nSection 299\tSection 300\nA person commits culpable homicide if the act Subject to certain exceptions, culpable\n\nby which the death is caused is done -\n\nINTENTION\n\nhomicide is murder if the act by which the death is caused is done -\n\n(a) with the intention of causing death; or\t(1) with the intention of causing death; or\n\n(b) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKNOWLEDGE\n(c) with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death.\n(2) \nwith the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or\n(3) with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or\n\n(4) with the knowledge that the act is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, and without any excuse or incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as is mentioned above.\n\n\nClause (b) of section 299 corresponds with clauses (2) and (3) of section 300. The distinguishing feature of the mens rea requisite under clause (2) is the knowledge possessed by the offender regarding the particular victim being in such a peculiar condition or state of health that the intentional harm caused to him is likely to be fatal, notwithstanding the fact that such harm would not in the ordinary way of nature be sufficient to cause death of a person in normal health or condition. It is noteworthy that the 'intention to cause death' is not an essential requirement of clause (2). Only the intention of causing the bodily injury coupled with the offender's knowledge of the likelihood of such injury causing the death of the particular victim is sufficient to bring\n\nthe killing within the ambit of this clause. This aspect of clause (2) is borne out by Illustration (b) appended to section 300.\nClause (b) of section 299 does not postulate any such knowledge on the part of the offender. Instances of cases falling under clause (2) of section 300 can be where the assailant causes death by a fist blow intentionally given knowing that the victim is suffering from an enlarged liver, or enlarged spleen or diseased heart and such blow is likely to cause death of that particular person as a result of the rupture of the liver, or spleen or the failure of the heart, as the case may be. If the assailant had no such knowledge about the disease or special frailty of the victim, nor an intention to cause death or bodily injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, the offence will not be murder, even if the injury which caused the death, was intentionally given.\nIn clause (3) of section 300, instead of the words, 'likely to cause death' occurring in the corresponding clause (b) of section 299, the words \"sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\" have been used. Obviously, the distinction lies between a bodily injury likely to cause death and a bodily injury suficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The distinction is fine but real, and, if overlooked, may result in miscarriage of justice. The difference between clause (b) of section 299 and clause (3) of section 300 is one of the degree of probability of death resulting from the intended bodily injury. To put it more broadly, it is the degree of probability of death which determines whether a culpable homicide is of the gravest, medium or the lowest degree. The word \"likely\" in clause (b) of section 299 conveys the sense of 'probable' as distinguished from a mere possibility. The words 'bodily injury... sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause 'death' mean that death will be the most probable result of the injury, having regard to the ordinary course of nature.\nFor cases to fall within clause (3), it is not necessary that the offender intended to cause death, so long as the death ensues from the intentional bodily injury or injuries sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature.\nClause (c) of section 299 and clause (4) of section 300 both require knowledge of the probability of the act causing death. It is not necessary for the purpose of this case to dilate much on the distinction between these corresponding clauses. It will be sufficient to say that clause (4) of section 300 would be applicable where the knowledge of the offender as to the probability of death of a person in general as distinguished from a particular person or persons being caused from his imminently dangerous act, approximates to a practical certainty. Such knowledge on the part of the offender must be of the highest degree of probability, the act having been committed by the offender without any excuse for incurring the risk of causing death or such injury as aforesaid.34.\nIn Ajit Singh v State of Punjab,35. the Supreme Court observed that:\n\nIn order to hold whether an offence would fall u/s. 302 or s. 304 Part I of the Code, the Courts have to be extremely cautious in examining whether the same falls u/s. 300 of the Code which states whether a culpable homicide is murder, or would it fall under its five exceptions which lay down when culpable homicide is not murder.\n\nIn other words, section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First finds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second finds detailed mention in the stated five Exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its wisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide 'amounting to murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code.36.\nFrom the above conspectus, it emerges that whenever a Court is confronted with the question of whether the offence is 'murder' or 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder' on the facts of a case, it will be convenient for it to approach the problem in\n\nthree stages. The question to be considered at the first stage would be, whether the accused has done an act by doing which he has caused the death of another. Proof of such causal connection between the act of the accused and the death leads to the second stage for considering whether that act of the accused amounts to \"culpable homicide\" as defined in section 299. If the answer to this question is prima facie found in the affirmative, the stage for considering the operation of section 300, IPC, 1860, is reached. This is the stage at which the Court should determine whether the facts proved by the prosecution bring the case within the ambit of any of the four clauses of the definition of 'murder' contained in section 300. If the answer to this question is in the negative, the offence would be 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', punishable under the first or the second part of section 304, depending, respectively, on whether the second or the third clause of section 299 is applicable. If this question is found in the positive, but the case comes within any of the Exceptions enumerated in section 300, the offence would still be 'culpable homicide not amounting to murder', punishable under the first part of section 304, IPC, 1860.\nThe above are only broad guidelines and not cast-iron imperatives. In most cases, their observance will facilitate the task of the Court. But sometimes the facts are so intertwined and the second and the third stages so telescoped into each other, that it may not be convenient to give a separate treatment to the matters involved in the second and third stages.\nTo sum up:\n\nSection 299 is divided into three parts. The first part refers to the act by which the death is caused by being done with the intention of causing death. That part corresponds to the first part of the section 300, IPC. The second part of section 299, IPC speaks of the intention to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. This has corresponding provisions in clauses \"Secondly\" and \"Thirdly\" of section 300, IPC, section 304, Part I, IPC, covers cases which by reason of the Exceptions under section 300, IPC, are taken out of the purview of cls. (1), (2) and (3) of section 300, IPC, but otherwise would fall within it and also cases which fall within the second part of section 299 but not within section 300 clauses (2) and\n(3). The third part of section 299 corresponds to \"fourthly\" of section s. 300. Section 304, Part-II, IPC, covers those cases which fall within the third part of section 299 but do not fall within the fourth clause of section 300.37.\n\nSection 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First finds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second finds detailed mention in the stated five Exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its wisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide 'amounting to murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code.38."

Honour crime is the genus and honour killing is the species, although a\n\ndangerous facet of it. In Arumugam Servai v State of TN,42. the Supreme Court strongly deprecated the practice of khap/katta panchayats taking law into their own hands and indulging in offensive activities which endanger the personal lives of the persons marrying according to their choice.43. Law Commission of India studied the matter and submitted the 242nd report to the Government. Some proposals are being mooted proposing amendments to section 300, IPC, 1860 by way of including what is called 'Honour Killing' as murder and shifting the burden of proof to the accused. But the Commission expressed the view that there is no need for introducing a provision in section 300, IPC, 1860 in order to bring the so called 'honour killings' within the ambit of this provision. According to the report, the existing provisions in IPC, 1860 are adequate enough to take care of the situations leading to overt acts of killing or causing bodily harm to the targeted person who allegedly undermined the honour of the caste or community. The commission suggested a new law (instead of amending IPC, 1860) to tackle the problem namely \"Prohibition of Interference with the Freedom of Matrimonial Alliances Bill 2011\".44.\n\nIn Shakti Vahini v UOI,45. the Supreme Court observed that torture or torment or ill- treatment in the name of honour that tantamounts to atrophy of choice of an individual relating to love and marriage by any assembly is illegal and cannot be allowed a moment of existence. In this case, the Supreme Court issued detailed preventive, remedial and punitive directives to prevent honour killings in the country."

In a case involving attack with sulphuric acid causing \"grievous injury\" where the doctor testified that such an attack may also cause death, the Court said that \"the word likely means 'probably' and can easily be distinguished from 'possibly'. When the chances of a thing happening are very high, we say that it will most probably happen\".46."

      "content": "In a case of murder by poisoning, the prosecution must establish (1) that death took place by poisoning, (2) that the accused had the poison in his possession, and (3) that the accused had an opportunity to administer poison to the deceased.47. These propositions were laid down by the Supreme Court in Dharambir Singh v State of Punjab, Criminal Appeal No. 98 of 1958, decided, Nov. 4, 1958 SC48. and were given anxious consideration by Hidayatullah, J, in Anant Chintaman Lagu v State of Bombay.49. The learned judge (afterwards CJ) did not consider them as invariable criteria of proof to be established by the prosecution in every case of murder by poisoning. This is so \"because\", as the learned judge said:\nevidently if after poisoning the victim, the accused destroyed all traces of the body, the first proposition would be incapable of being proved except by circumstantial evidence. Similarly, if the accused gave a victim something to eat and the victim died immediately on the ingestion of that food with symptoms of poisoning and poison, found in the viscera, the\n\nrequirement of proving that the accused was possessed of the poison would follow the circumstance that the accused gave the victim something to eat and need not be separately proved.\n\nFollowing this opinion in the case of Bhupinder Singh v State of Punjab50. and dispensing with the need for proof of possession of poison, the Supreme Court said that:\nwe do not consider it necessary that there should be acquittal on the failure of the prosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. Murder by poison is invariably committed under the cover and cloak of secrecy. Nobody will administer poison to another in the presence of others. The person who administers poison  will not keep a portion of it\nfor the investigating officer to come and collect it  [He] would naturally take care to\neliminate and destroy the evidence against him.... It would be impossible for the prosecution to prove possession of poison with the accused. The prosecution may, however, establish other circumstances consistent only with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused. The Court then would not be justified in acquitting the accused on the ground that the prosecution has failed to prove possession of poison with the accused.\n\nContinuing further, Shetty, J said:\n\nThe poison murder cases are not to be put outside the rule of circumstantial evidence. There may be very many obvious facts and circumstances in which the Court may be justified in drawing permissible inference that the accused was in possession of the poison in question.... The insistence on proof of possession of poison invariably in every case is\nneither desirable nor practicable. It would mean to introduce an extraneous ingredient to the offence of murder by poisoning.\n\nWhere, therefore, neither motive nor administration of poison nor its possession by the accused could be proved, the accused had to be acquitted.51. Where it is proved that the accused administered poison, the accused must be presumed to have knowledge that his act was likely to cause death.52. If the prosecution failed to prove the cause of death, the fact that the accused failed to explain the cause of death cannot be the basis of conviction. Accused was acquitted where neither post-mortem report nor FSL report showed the administration of poison.53. Where the allegation was that the death was caused by poison mixed with alcohol, but no remnants of poisonous substance were found either in the two bottles or in the steel glass but were found only in the earth so collected from the place of occurrence, accused acquitted.54."

In the case of Mangesh v State of Maharashtra,57. the Supreme Court stated\n\nthe circumstances from which it may be gathered as to whether there was intention to cause death. It included circumstances like nature of the weapon; on what part of the body the blow was given; the amount of force; was it a result of a sudden fight or quarrel; whether the incident occurred by chance or was pre-meditated; prior animosity; grave and sudden provocation; heat of passion; did the accused take any undue advantage; did he act cruelly; number of blows given, etc. Even if none of the injuries by itself was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, cumulatively such injuries may be sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.58."

The sufficiency spoken of in this clause, as already noticed, is the high probability of death in the ordinary course of nature, and if such sufficiency exists and death is caused and the injury causing it is intentional, the case would fall under clause thirdly of section 300. All the conditions which are a prerequisite for the applicability of this clause have been established and the offence committed by the accused, in the instant case was \"murder\".59.\nWhat is required for the prosecution to prove to bring the case under clause thirdly to section 300? First, it must be established, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; Second, the nature of the injury must be proved and these are purely objective investigations; third, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended; and once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds further; and fourth, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the offender. Once these four elements are established by the prosecution (and, of course, the burden is on the prosecution throughout) the offence is murder under section 300 \"thirdly\". Once the intention to cause the bodily injury actually found to be present is proved, the rest of the enquiry is purely objective and the only question is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.60. On this particular point, there is the following pertinent observation of the Supreme Court:61.\nThe nature of the offence does not depend merely on the location of the injury caused by the accused. The intention of the person causing the injury has to be gathered from a careful examination of the facts and circumstances of each given case….\n\nThe Supreme Court also observed that the intention to cause the requisite type of injury is a subjective inquiry, but that once that type of intention is found in the assailant, the further inquiry whether the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death is of objective nature.62."

Ajit Singh v State of Punjab,65. and Mohinder Pal Jolly v State of Punjab,66. the Supreme Court opined thus:\n\nThe evidence led by the parties with reference to all these circumstances greatly helps the Court in coming to a final conclusion as to under which penal provision of the Code the accused is liable to be punished. This can also be decided from another point of view i.e. by applying the \"principle of exclusion\". This principle could be applied while taking recourse to a two- stage process of determination. First, the Court may record a preliminary finding if the accused had committed an offence punishable under the substantive provisions of s. 302 of the Code, that is, \"culpable homicide amounting to murder\". Then second, it may proceed to examine if the case fell in any of the Exceptions detailed in s. 300 of the Code. This would doubly ensure that the conclusion arrived at by the Court is correct on facts and sustainable in law. We are stating such a proposition to indicate that such a determination would better serve the ends of criminal justice delivery.67.\n\nThe third clause of section 300 views the matter from a general standpoint. Here, the emphasis is on the sufficiency of the injury in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The sufficiency is the high probability of death in the ordinary way of nature. When this sufficiency exists and death follows and the causing of such injury is intended, the offence is murder. Sometimes the nature of the weapon used, sometimes the part of the body on which the injury is caused and sometimes both are relevant.68. In some cases, the sufficiency of injury to cause death in the ordinary course of nature must be proved and cannot be inferred from the fact that death has in fact taken place. In such a case, it may not be open to argue backwards from the death to the blow, to hold that the sufficiency is established because death did result. As death can take place from other causes, the sufficiency is required to be proved by other and separate evidence.69."

However, where the medical evidence goes so far that it completely rules out all possibility of the ocular evidence being true, the ocular evidence may be disbelieved.70. The opinion given by a medical witness need not be the last word on the subject. Such opinion shall be tested by the Court. If the opinion is bereft of logic or objectivity, Court is not obliged to go by that opinion. After all, opinion is what is formed in the mind of a person regarding a fact situation. If one doctor forms one opinion and another doctor forms a different opinion on the same facts, it is open to the judge to adopt the view which is more objective or probable. Similarly, if the opinion given by one doctor is not consistent with probability, the Court has no liability to go by that opinion merely because it is said by the doctor. Of course, due weight must be given to opinions given by persons who are experts in the particular subject.71.

'Sudden' means an action which must be quick and unexpected so far as to provoke the accused. The question of whether provocation was grave and sudden is a question of fact and not one of law. Each case is to be considered according to its own facts.87.\nThe mode of resentment should bear some proper and reasonable relationship to the sort of provocation that has been given. The test to be applied is that of the effect of the provocation on a reasonable man, so that an unusually excitable or pugnacious individual is not entitled to rely on provocation which would not have led an ordinary person to act as he did. It is important to consider whether a sufficient interval has elapsed since the provocation to allow a reasonable person time to cool, and account must be taken of the instrument with which the homicide had been effected.88. The mode of resentment must bear a reasonable relationship to the provocation.89.\nPrinciples relating to \"grave and sudden provocation\" summarised by the Supreme Court\n\n(1) The test of \"grave and sudden\" provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused was placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. (2) In India, words and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the First Exception to section 300 of the Indian Penal Code.\n(3) The mental background created by the previous act of the victim may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence.\n(4) The fatal blow should be clearly traced to the influence of passion arising from that provocation and not after the passion had cooled down by lapse of time, or otherwise giving room and scope for premeditation and calculation.\nKM Nanavati v State of Maharashtra.90.\n\nAn offence resulting from grave and sudden provocation would normally mean that a person placed in such circumstances could lose self-control but only temporarily and that too, in proximity to the time of provocation. The provocation could be an act or series of acts done by the deceased to the accused resulting in inflicting of injury.91.\nThe test of \"grave and sudden\" provocation is whether a reasonable man, belonging to the same class of society as the accused, placed in the situation in which the accused was placed would be so provoked as to lose his self-control. Words and gestures may also, under certain circumstances, cause grave and sudden provocation to an accused so as to bring his act within the Exception. The mental background created by the previous act of the victim may be taken into consideration in ascertaining whether the subsequent act caused grave and sudden provocation for committing the offence. The fatal blow should be clearly traced to the influence of passion arising from that provocation and not after the passion had cooled down by lapse of time, or otherwise giving room and scope for premeditation and calculation.92."

The authors of the Code observed:\nWherever the limits of the right of private defence may be placed, and with whatever degree of accuracy they may be marked, we are inclined to think that it will always be expedient to make a separation between murder and... voluntary culpable homicide in defence.\nThe chief reason for making this separation is that the law itself invites men to the very verge of the crime which we have designated as voluntary culpable homicide in defence. It prohibits such homicide indeed; but it authorizes acts which lie very near to such homicide; and this circumstance, we think, greatly mitigates the guilt of such homicide.\nThat a man who deliberately kills another in order to prevent that other from pulling his nose should be allowed to go absolutely unpunished would be most dangerous. The law punishes and ought to punish such killing; but we cannot think that the law ought to punish such killing as murder; for the law itself has encouraged the slayer to inflict on the assailant any harm short of death which may be necessary for the purpose of repelling the outrage; to give the assailant a cut with a knife across the fingers which may render his right hand useless to him for life, or to hurl him downstairs with such force as to break his leg; and it seems difficult to conceive that circumstances which would be a full justification of any violence short of homicide should not be a mitigation of the guilt of homicide. That a man should be merely exercising a right by fracturing the skull and knocking out the eye of an assailant, and should be guilty of the highest crime in the Code if he kills the same assailant; that there should be only a single step between perfect innocence and murder, between perfect impunity and liability to capital punishment, seems unreasonable. In a case in which the law itself empowers an individual to inflict any harm short of death, it ought hardly, we think, to visit him with the highest punishment if he inflicts death.102."

It has to be established that the accused persons were under such grave apprehension about the safety of their life and property that retaliation to the extent done was absolutely necessary. Right of private defence has been rightly discarded.107. After an altercation and exchange of abuses, two persons aimed rifles at each other.

      "title": "\"Fight\": meaning of.—",
      "content": "The 'fight' occurring in Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860 is not defined in IPC, 1860. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case.118.\n\nThe language of Exception 4 to section 300 is, thus, clear that culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel provided the offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. In order to bring a case under Exception (4) to section 300, IPC, 1860, the evidence must show that the accused without any premeditation and in a heat of passion and without having undue advantage had not acted in cruel manner. Every one of these circumstances is required to be proved to attract Exception\n(4) to section 300, IPC, 1860 and it is not sufficient to prove only some of them. None of the ingredients have been proved in evidence to bring the case under Exception (4) to section 300, IPC, 1860.119. Case comes under Exception 4 where the prosecution evidence sufficiently suggested that a scuffle had taken place on the dingy where the appellant and his companions were trying to recover the dingy while the deceased was preventing them from doing so, and in the course of this sudden fight and in the heat of passion, the appellant assaulted the deceased and pushed him in the sea eventually resulting in his death.120. Where there was no pre-meditation and the act was committed in a heat of passion and the appellant had not taken any undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner and there was a fight between the parties, the Supreme Court found that the case falls under the fourth exception to section 300, IPC, 1860 and the conviction altered from section 302, IPC, 1860 to section 304, Part I, IPC, 1860.121. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning.122.\n\nThis Exception was held not to apply to a case where two bodies of men, for the most part armed with deadly weapons, deliberately entered into an unlawful fight, each being prepared to cause the death of the other, and aware that his own might follow, but determined to do his best in self-defence, and in the course of the struggle death ensued.123. An unpremeditated assault (in which death is caused) committed in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel comes within the Exception.124.\nException 4 is attracted only when there is a fight or quarrel which requires mutual provocation and blows by both sides in which the offender does not take undue advantage.125.\nA \"sudden fight\" implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor could in such cases the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1.126.\n\nThe word 'fight' conveys something more than a verbal quarrel.127. It takes two to make a fight. It is not necessary that weapons should be used in a fight. In order to constitute fight, it is necessary that blows should be exchanged even if they do not all find their target.128. The fight must be with the person who is killed and not with another person.129. The words \"undue advantage\" in this Exception means \"unfair advantage\".130. Where a wordy quarrel had taken place and the quarrel had led to the use of weapons by both the parties against each other, the Supreme Court said that it could not be held to be a kind of case in which the accused had deliberately attacked the deceased with an intention to kill them. It is a case which would fall under the Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860.131. Where on account of a sudden impulse and without any intention or knowledge of the impending consequences, the accused squeezed the testicles of the other causing shock, cardiac arrest and instant death, the Supreme Court held that the offence in question amounted to grievous hurt punishable under section 325 and not under this section.132. Where two cultivating parties working in their respective fields picked up a sudden quarrel over the dividing line and death ensued, there was no previous ill-will between them and, therefore, no pre-meditation,\n\nconviction was altered from under section 302 to one under section 304, Part I read with section 34.133. Where, on the other hand, the incident did take place at the spur of the moment and evidence showed that the accused persons intentionally assaulted the deceased and his family in a brutal manner, their conviction under section 300 was held to be proper.134. The accused persons cannot argue successfully that the incident occurred at the spur of the moment where they came to the place of occurrence armed with deadly weapons. In this case, the evidence established that it was a pre-meditated act, thus their conviction for the offence punishable under section 302, IPC, 1860 was held proper.135. In a sudden fight in heat of passion and without pre-meditation the accused armed with deadly weapon inflicted fatal blows on the unarmed deceased even when he fell on the ground. It was held that Exception 4 of section 300 was not attracted and the conviction of the accused for murder was proper.136.\n\nWhere the offender took an undue advantage or acted in a cruel and unusual manner, it was held that the benefit of Exception 4 could not be given to him. The Supreme Court observed that the weapon used or the manner of attack is out of all proportion, that fact must be taken into consideration for deciding whether undue advantage was taken.137.\nA person opened the door on the call of his uncle who was under assault. He was unarmed and came out to see what was happening. He received a gunshot at his chest causing death. The Court said that the appellant had taken undue advantage of his position at the time. He could not claim the benefit of Exception 4.138.\nWhere though there was a sudden quarrel between the accused and the deceased, there was absolutely no fight between the two as there was no exchange of blows, nor any attack from the side of the deceased who was totally unarmed but nevertheless the accused attacked the deceased with an axe causing his death, it was held that his case did not fall either within Exception 4 or Exception 2 and he was squarely liable under section 302, IPC, 1860.139. A sudden fight developed between the accused and the deceased while the former was telling the latter that he should not carry his cattle by the side of the field of the accused. Three brothers of the accused rushed to his rescue and belaboured the deceased with whatever weapons they had in their hands. The deceased died of multiple injuries and broken bones. The ferocious cruelty established intention to cause death and took the case out of the exception.140.\nThe accused abused a road sweeper who happened to throw mud on him. The father of the sweeper slapped the accused. The infuriated accused went away and came back with others. He alone, however, inflicted the fatal blow. The occurrence was of sudden origin because the gap between the injury and quarrel was that of only a few minutes. There was no previous enmity and blows were not repeated as the deceased fell down helpless. There was no unusual cruelty. The benefit of Exception 4 was allowed.141. In a quarrel between the accused and his father, the accused attacked his father with a dagger causing death and also attacked the intervener who were his stepmother and sisters. No injury was caused to the accused because all others were unarmed. The accused took undue advantage of that fact. He acted in a cruel manner. The exception was not attracted. He was guilty of murder.142. It cannot be said in all cases of a single blow that section 302 would not be attracted. A single blow in some cases may entail conviction under section 302 in some cases or under section 304 and in some cases under section 326. Acting on this principle in a case where the victim was invited to a particular place and there three associates of the accused caught hold of him and the accused delivered a single knife blow on the chest, about which it could not be said that it was not inflicted without premeditation, the Court said that it could not be said that the accused had not taken undue advantage. Exception 4 was not attracted.143.\n\nWhere the accused, who had gone along with the deceased and others, picked up a quarrel with the deceased, entered his house, and came back with a knife and gave blows to the deceased and others who tried to stop them and then ran away, it was held that Exception 4 to section 300 was not applicable. Conviction under section 302 was proper.144. A quarrel took place between a son and his father just outside the son's house. The son dragged the father into the Courtyard. His other sons came out to his rescue. The son retreated into the room, bolted it from inside and shot at them from the window. One of his brothers received a bullet at his chest and died. The plea of self- defence was not accepted. His father and brothers were the eye-witnesses who were naturally there for saving the skin of their father. The accused shot at them from the bolted security of his room.145.\nA previous quarrel triggered off because of sarcastic remarks made during the occasion of a marriage. Three accused started shooting with their respective guns at unarmed victims from close range on vital parts of their bodies. The victims had merely indulged in verbal duel with them. The accused acted in cruel and unusual manner. Conviction for the offence of murder was held to be proper, Exception 4 being not applicable.146."

      "content": "Exception 4 of section 300, IPC, 1860 covers acts done in a sudden fight. The said exception deals with a case of prosecution not covered by the first exception, after which its place would have been more appropriate. The exception is founded upon the same principle, for in both there is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of Exception 1, there is total deprivation of self-control, in the case of Exception 4, there is only that heat of passion which clouds men's sober reason and urges them to deeds which they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the direct consequence of that provocation. In fact, Exception 4 deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may have been struck, or some provocation given in the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A 'sudden fight' implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1. There is no previous deliberation or determination to fight. A fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the other had not aggravated it by his own conduct, it would not have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion the share of blame which attaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) without premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the offender's having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have been with the person killed. To bring a case within Exception 4, all the ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted that the 'fight' occurring in Exception 4 to section 300, IPC, 1860 is not defined in the IPC, 1860. It takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion requires that there must be no time for the passions to cool down and in this case, the parties have worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation. It must further be shown that\n\nthe offender has not taken undue advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner. The expression 'undue advantage' as used in the provision means 'unfair advantage'.147. In both cases, there is absence of premeditation. But in Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception there is such heat of passion as clouds sober reason and urges the man to do something which he would not otherwise do. A sudden fight implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The homicide in such a case is not traceable to unilateral provocation. In such cases, the whole blame cannot be attributed to one side. It may be that a fight was initiated by one side but without aggravating provocation from the other side it might not have taken the serious turn. A situation of mutual provocation and aggravation develops making it difficult to apportion the blame between the two sides.148."

The soldier who, at the entreaty of a wounded comrade, puts that comrade out of pain, the friend who supplies laudanum to a person suffering the torment of a lingering disease, the freed man who in ancient times held out the sword that his master might fall on it, the highborn native of India who stabs the females of his family at their own entreaty in order to save them from the licentiousness of a band of marauders, would, except in Christian societies, scarcely be thought culpable, and even in Christian societies would not be regarded by the public, and ought not to be treated by the law, as assassins.149.\n\nThis exception abrogates the rule of English law that a combatant in a fair duel who kills his opponent is guilty of murder.

It must be found that the person killed with a full knowledge of the facts, determined to suffer death, or take the risk of death; and that this determination continued up to and existed at the moment of his death.150. The consent must have been given unconditionally and without any pre-reservation.151.\nThe case supposed in the illustration to Exception 5 is one of the offences expressly made punishable by section 305."

The mere fact that the body of a murdered person has not been found is not a ground for refusing to convict the accused of murder. But when the body is not forthcoming, the strongest possible evidence as to the fact of the murder should be insisted on before conviction.155. Such evidence could come from the testimony of eye-witnesses or from circumstantial evidence or from both.156. If the prosecution is successful in providing cogent and satisfactory proof of the victim having met a homicidal death, absence of corpus delicti will not by itself be fatal to a charge of murder.157."

There may however be cases where, on account of close proximity of place and time between the event of the accused having been last seen with the deceased and the factum of death, a rational mind may be persuaded to reach an irresistible conclusion that either the accused should explain how and in what circumstances the victim suffered the death or should own the liability for the homicide.172. But in Arabindra Mukherjee v State of WB,173.,174. it was held that once the accused was last seen with the deceased, the onus is upon him to show that either he was not involved in the occurrence at all or that he had left the deceased at her home or at any other reasonable place. To rebut the evidence of last seen and its consequences in law, the onus was upon the accused to lead\n\nevidence in order to prove his innocence. In C Perumal v Rajasekaran,175.,176. there was a time lag of two days in last seen together of A2– A5 with the deceased and Court found it difficult to connect them with the incident. Where the accused was last seen together with the deceased by his wife, but the prosecution could not establish the cause of death, the accused was not convicted based on the last seen theory.177.\nThe circumstance of last seen together does not by itself and necessarily lead to the inference that it was the accused who committed the crime. There must be something more establishing the connectivity between the accused and the crime. Mere non- explanation on the part of the accused by itself, cannot lead to proof of guilt against the appellant.178. Where it was found that the deceased was in the company of the accused prior to one week of the post-mortem of the deceased and it was also found through the post-mortem that the murder was about one week ago, the Court held that the last seen theory applies.179.\nWhere there was a clear gap of 51 hours and 45 minutes between the time when the victim was last seen in the company of the accused and the time of his death, it was held that this time gap was too wide to act upon the last seen theory.180."

In Narendra Singh v State of UP, AIR 1987 SC 1268 : 1987 Cr LJ 1070 : (1987) 2 SCC 236 , repeated blows were inflicted on vital parts of the body. This was held\n\nto be intentional murder.

Jai Prakash v State (Delhi Admn), (1991) 2 SCC 32 : (1991) 1 Crimes 474 : 1991 SCC (Cri) 299 . Reiterated in Kesar Singh v State of Haryana, (2008) 15 SCC 753 [LNIND 2008 SC 1001] , it does not matter that there was no intention to cause death, or even to cause an injury of a kind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature (not that there is any real distinction between the two), or that there is no knowledge that an act of that kind will be likely to cause death. Once the intention to cause the bodily injury is actually found to be proved, the rest of the enquiry is purely objective and the only question is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Namdeo v State of Maharashtra, (2007) 14 SCC 150 [LNIND 2007 SC 316] : 2007 Cr LJ 1819 , head injury caused with axe sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, hence intention was to cause death.

Clause (3) applied, punishable under section 302. Settu v State of TN, 2006 Cr LJ 3889 , no intention to cause death, but injury caused with a knife on a vital part and which was sufficient to cause death, amounted to murder.

Since the eye- witnesses therein were not found to be reliable, Supreme Court acquitted the appellant therein. In Kapildeo Mandal, (2008) 16 SCC 99 [LNIND 2007 SC 1390] , all the eye-witnesses had categorically stated that the deceased was injured by the use of firearm, whereas the medical evidence specifically indicated that no firearm injury was found on the deceased. Court held that, when the evidence of the eye-witnesses is totally inconsistent with the evidence given by the medical experts, then evidence is appreciated in a different perspective by the courts. It was observed that when medical evidence specifically rules out the injury claimed to have been inflicted as per the eye-witnesses' version, then the court can draw adverse inference that the prosecution version is not trustworthy.\n73.

    },
    "section301": {
      "title": "Culpable homicide by causing death of person other than person whose death was intended.",
      "content": "If a person, by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing the death of any person, whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been if he had caused the death of the person whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nDoctrine of transferred malice.—Section 301 of IPC, 1860 specifies that if a person by doing anything which he intends or knows to be likely to cause death, commits culpable homicide by causing death of any person whose death he neither intends, nor knows himself to be likely to cause, culpable homicide committed by the offender is of the description of which it would have been, if he had caused the death of the person, whose death he intended or knew himself to be likely to cause.183. Blow aimed at the intended victim, if alights on another, offence is the same as it would have been if the blow had struck the intended victim.184. This section lays down that culpable homicide may be committed by causing the death of a person whom the offender neither intended, nor knew himself to be likely, to kill. This section embodies what the English authors describe as the doctrine of transfer of malice or the transmigration of motive. Under this section, if A intends to kill B but kills C whose death he neither intends nor knows himself to be likely to cause, the intention to kill C is, by law attributed to him.185.\nIf the killing takes place in the course of doing an act which a person intends or knows to be likely to cause death, it ought to be treated as if the real intention of the killer had been actually carried out.\nWhere a mistake is made in respect of the person, as where the offender shoots at A supposing that he is shooting at B, it is clear that the difference of person can make none in the offence or its consequences; the crime consists in the wilful doing of a prohibited act; the act of shooting at A was wilful, although the offender mistook him for another.\nWhere the accused was deliberately trying to shoot at a fleeing man who had criticised his father in a School Committee Meeting but unfortunately his own maternal uncle came in between him and the intended victim and thus got killed, it was held that the act of the accused was nothing but murder under section 302 read with section 301, IPC, 1860.186. In an altercation between parties, the accused persons fired indiscriminately upon the fleeing party, one shot hit a person and second caused the death of the complainant's 10-year-old son. The episode took place in a commercial locality. The death was held to be intentional murder punishable under sections\n\n300/301.187. The accused reached his intended victim's house. The latter hid himself somewhere else. The accused chased him there and standing before that house fired into it. The housewife became prey and fell dead. It was held that under the doctrine of transfer of malice, the accused must be convicted under sections 302 and 307 and sentenced to life imprisonment.188. Where the accused intended to kill a particular person by his lorry but another person chanced to come before the lorry and happened to be killed, an offence under this section was committed and the accused was convicted under section 302.189.\n\nSimilarly, there will be no difference where the injury intended for one falls on another by accident. If A makes a thrust at B, meaning to kill, and C throwing himself between, receives the thrust and dies, A will answer for it as if his mortal purpose had taken place on B.\nThe same principle is applicable where, through accident or the mistake of a party not privy to the criminal design, the mischief falls either on a person not intended, or on the party intended but in a different manner from that intended.190. Accused had entered the house of witness to kill him but due to non-availability of electricity and under the wrong impression he killed the deceased. Death of deceased can be said to be accidental due to mistaken identity rather than any intentional act of accused. Order of conviction of accused under section 302, IPC, 1860 is modified to one under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.191.\n\nIn a scuffle between accused persons and the complainant's party, one member on the accused's side fired a shot at a particular member on the complainant's side but the shot actually hit another person who died. The Court held that the doctrine of transferred malice was attracted. The act of the accused would be covered by section\n304 and he was liable to be convicted under Part II of that section, though the deceased was neither aimed at nor intended to be harmed by the accused.192.\nIt is not a disputed fact as to whose fire shot resulted in the death of the deceased. The only question which is to be examined here is whether the offence committed by the respondent is culpable homicide amounting to murder, punishable under section 302 or culpable homicide not amounting to murder, punishable under section 304, Part I. Here, the intention on the part of the respondent-accused in causing bodily injury as is likely to cause death is also not a disputed fact. The only thing which is to be tested is whether the bodily injury is covered under either of the clauses of section 300 of IPC, 1860 (transfer of malice doctrine applied).193."

It stipulates a punishment of death or imprisonment for life and fine. Once an offender is found by the Court to be guilty of the offence of murder under section 302, then it has to sentence the offender to either death or for imprisonment for life. The Court has no power to impose any lesser sentence."

The provision of section 367(5) of the 1898 Code reads as follows:\n(5) If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death, and the Court sentences him to any punishment other than death, the Court shall in its judgment state the reason why sentence of death was not passed.\nIn 1955, Cr PC (Amendment) Act, 1955 deleted the aforesaid section 367(5) of the 1898 Code. As a result of this amendment, which came into effect from 1 January 1956, it was no longer necessary for a Court to record in its judgment, in case of conviction in connection with an offence punishable with death, any reason for not imposing the death sentence. Thus, in the new Code, the discretion of the judge to impose death sentence has been narrowed, for the Court has to provide special reasons for imposing a sentence of death. It has made imprisonment for life the rule and death sentence an exception, in the matter of awarding punishment for murder.197. Reference to extenuating or mitigating circumstances in a case of death penalty was made possibly for the first time by Supreme Court in the case of Nawab Singh v State of UP.198. The Court held that in the facts of that case, murder was a cruel and deliberate one and there were no extenuating circumstances. After the amendment of 1898 Code, in the year 1955, the first case relating to death sentence, which came before Supreme Court was that of Vadivelu Thevar v State of Madras,199. in which it was held that the question of sentence has to be determined, not with reference to the volume or character of the evidence adduced by the prosecution in support of the prosecution case, but with reference to the fact whether there are any extenuating circumstances which can be said to mitigate the enormity of the crime. If the Court is satisfied that there are such mitigating circumstances, only then, it would be justified in imposing the lesser of the two sentences provided by law."

      "title": "Constitutionality of Death penalty.—",
      "content": "The constitutionality of death sentence was challenged in the case of Jagmohan Singh v State of UP.200. The Constitution Bench while upholding the constitutionality of death penalty examined whether total discretion can be conferred on the judges in awarding death sentence, when the statute does not provide any guidelines on how to exercise the same. The decision in Jagmohan Singh (supra) was rendered when Cr PC, 1973 was not in existence. However, the aforesaid position substantially changed with the introduction of a changed sentencing structure under Cr PC, 1973. In Rajendra Prasad v State of UP,201. it was held that the special reasons necessary for imposing a death penalty must relate not to the crime but to the criminal. It could be awarded only if the security of the state and society, public order in the interest of the general public compelled that course.\nProposition laid down by the Constitution Bench in Jagmohan Singh's Case\n\n(i) The general legislative policy that underlines the structure of our criminal law, principally contained in the IPC, 1860 and Cr PC, 1973, is to define an offence with sufficient clarity and to prescribe only the maximum punishment therefore, and to allow a very wide discretion to the Judge in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment.\nWith the solitary exception of section 303, the same policy permeates section 302 and some other sections of IPC, 1860, where the maximum punishment is the death penalty.\n(ii) (a) No exhaustive enumeration of aggravating or mitigating circumstances which should be considered when sentencing an offender, is possible. \"The infinite variety of cases and facets to each case would make general standards either meaningless 'boiler plate' or a statement of the obvious that no Jury (Judge) would need.\" (referred to McGoutha v California.202.\n(b) The impossibility of laying down standards is at the very core of the criminal law as administered in India which invests the Judges with a very wide discretion in the matter of fixing the degree of punishment.\n(iii) The view taken by the plurality in Furman v Georgia,203. decided by the Supreme Court of the United States, to the effect, that a law which gives uncontrolled and unguided discretion to the Jury (or the Judge) to choose arbitrarily between a sentence of death and imprisonment for a capital offence, violates the Eighth Amendment, is not applicable in India. We do not have in our Constitution any provision like the Eighth Amendment, nor are we at liberty to apply the test of reasonableness with the freedom with which the Judges of the Supreme Court of America are accustomed to apply \"the due process\" clause. There are grave doubts about the expediency of transplanting western experience in our country. Social conditions are different and so also the general intellectual level. Arguments which would be valid in respect of one area of the world may not hold good in respect of another area.\n(iv) (a) This discretion in the matter of sentence is to be exercised by the Judge judicially, after balancing all the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of the crime.\n(b) The discretion is liable to be corrected by Superior Courts. The exercise of judicial discretion on well-recognised principles is, in the final analysis, the safest possible safeguard for the accused. In view of the above, it will be impossible to say that there would be at all any discrimination, since crime as crime may appear to be superficially\n\nthe same, but the facts and circumstances of a crime are widely different. Thus considered, the provision in section 302, IPC, 1860 is not violative of Article 14 of the Constitution on the ground that it confers on the Judges an unguided and uncontrolled discretion in the matter of awarding capital punishment or imprisonment for life.\n(v) (a) Relevant facts and circumstances impinging on the nature and circumstances of the crime can be brought before the Court at the preconviction stage, notwithstanding the fact that no formal procedure for producing evidence regarding such facts and circumstances had been specifically provided. Where counsel addresses the Court with regard to the character and standing of the accused, they are duly considered by the Court unless there is something in the evidence itself which belies him or the Public Prosecutor challenges the facts.\n(b) It is to be emphasised that in exercising its discretion to choose either of the two alternative sentences provided in section 302, IPC, 1860:\nthe Court is principally concerned with the facts and circumstances whether aggravating or mitigating, which are connected with the particular crime under inquiry. All such facts and circumstances are capable of being proved in accordance with the provisions of the Indian Evidence Act in a trial regulated by the CrPC. The trial does not come to an end until all the relevant facts are proved and the counsel on both sides have an opportunity to address the Court. The only thing that remains is for the Judge to decide on the guilt and punishment and that is whats. 306(2) and s. 309(2), CrPC purport to provide for. These provisions are part of the procedure established by law and unless it is shown that they are invalid for any other reasons they must be regarded as valid. No reasons are offered to show that they are constitutionally invalid and hence the death sentence imposed after trial in accordance with the procedure established by law is not unconstitutional under Art. 21.\n\n[Jagmohan Singh v State of UP.]204."

      "title": "Legislative Change.—",
      "content": "The 41st Law Commission Report proposed extensive changes in the 1898 Code. In paragraph 23.2 of the said report, the Law Commission recommended a set of new provisions for governing \"trials before a Court of sessions\". With regard tosection 309 of the 1898 Code, the Law Commission recommended that hearing of the accused was most desirable before passing any sentence against him. This recommendation was accepted and incorporated while enacting section 235, Cr PC in 1973 Code within Chapter XVIII of the same under the heading \"Trial before a Court of Sessions\". The most significant change brought about by the incorporation of the recommendation of the Law Commission, is the giving of an opportunity of hearing to the accused on the question of sentence. This opportunity of hearing at the post-conviction stage gives the accused an opportunity to raise fundamental issues for adjudication and effective determination by Court of its sentencing discretion in a fair and reasonable manner. In Santa Singh v State of Punjab,206. the Supreme Court held that this provision is in consonance with the modern trends in penology and sentencing procedures. It was further held that proper exercise of sentencing discretion calls for consideration of various factors like the nature of offence, the circumstances—both extenuating or aggravating, the prior criminal record, if any, of the offender, the age of the offender, his background, his education, his personal life, his social adjustment, the emotional and mental condition of the offender, the prospects for the rehabilitation of the offender, the possibility of his rehabilitation in the life of community, the possibility of treatment or training of the offender, the possibility that the sentence may serve as a deterrent to crime by the offender or by others."

      "title": "Phase-II Doctrine of \"Rarest of rare\" (Shifting the focus from crime to criminal).—",
      "content": "In Bachan Singh v State of Punjab,207. another Constitution Bench, while upholding the constitutional validity of death sentence observed that for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence an exception. The principal questions considered in this case were:\n(i) Whether death penalty provided for the offence of murder in Section 302, Penal Code is unconstitutional.\n(ii) If the answer to the foregoing question be in the negative, whether the sentencing procedure provided in Section 354(3) of the CrPC, 1973 (Act 2 of 1974) is unconstitutional on the ground that it invests the Court with unguided and untrammelled discretion and allows death sentence to be arbitrarily or freakishly imposed on a person found guilty of murder or any other capital offence punishable under the Indian Penal Code with death or, in the alternative, with imprisonment for life.\n\nThe conclusion of the Constitution Bench was that the sentence of death ought to be given only in the 'rarest of rare cases' [See the Box with 'Supreme Court Guidelines in Bachan Singh'] and it should be given only when the option of awarding the sentence of life imprisonment is \"unquestionably foreclosed\". It laid down the framework law on this point. Bachan Singh effectively opened up Phase II of a sentencing policy by shifting the focus from the crime to the crime and the criminal.\nSupreme Court Guidelines in Bachan Singh\n\n(i) The extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted except in gravest cases of extreme culpability;\n(ii) Before opting for the death penalty, the circumstances of the 'offender' also require to be taken into consideration along with the circumstances of the\n\n'crime';\n(iii) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception. In other words, death sentence must be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be an altogether inadequate punishment having regard to the relevant circumstances of the crime, and only provided, the option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be conscientiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all the relevant circumstances;\n(iv) A balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and the mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised.\n[Bachan Singh v State of Punjab.208.]\n\nThe judgment in Machhi Singh v State of Rajasthan,209. did not only state the above guidelines in some elaboration, but also specified the mitigating circumstances which could be considered by the Court while determining such serious issues.210. Despite the legislative change and Bachan Singh discarding proposition (iv)(a) of Jagmohan Singh, Supreme Court in Machhi Singh revived the \"balancing\" of aggravating and mitigating circumstances through a balance sheet theory. In doing so, it sought to compare aggravating circumstances pertaining to a crime with the mitigating circumstances pertaining to a criminal. It hardly need be stated, with respect, that these are completely distinct and different elements and cannot be compared with one another. A balance sheet cannot be drawn up of two distinct and different constituents of an incident. Nevertheless, the balance sheet theory held the field post Machhi Singh.211.\nSupreme Court Guidelines in Machhi Singh\n\nFactors to be considered while determining the \"rarest of rare\" case\n\nI. Manner of commission of murder\n\n33. When the murder is committed in an extremely brutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting, or dastardly manner so as to arouse intense and extreme indignation of the community. For instance.\n\n(i) When the house of the victim is set aflame with the end in view to roast him alive in the house,\n(ii) When the victim is subjected to inhuman acts of torture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her death.\n(iii) When the body of the victim is cut into pieces or his body is dismembered in a fiendish manner.\nII. Motive for commission of murder\n\n34. When the murder is committed for a motive which evinces total depravity and meanness. For instance, when (a) a hired assassin commits murder for the sake of money or reward; (b) a cold-blooded murder is committed with a deliberate design in order to inherit property or to gain control over property of a ward or a person under the control of the murderer or vis-a-vis whom the murderer is in a dominating position or in a position of trust; (c) a murder is committed in the course for betrayal of the motherland.\nIII. Anti-social or socially abhorrent nature of the crime\n\n(a) When murder of a member of a Scheduled Caste or minority community etc., is committed not for personal reasons but in circumstances which arouse social wrath. For instance, when such a crime is committed in order to terrorise such persons and frighten them into fleeing from a place or in order to deprive them of, or make them surrender, lands or benefits conferred on them with a view to reverse past injustices and in order to restore the social balance.\n(b) In cases of 'bride burning' and what are known as 'dowry-deaths' or when murder is committed in order to remarry for the sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry another woman on account of infatuation.\nIV. Magnitude of crime\n\n35. When the crime is enormous in proportion. For instance, when multiple murders say of all or almost all the members of a family or a large number of persons of a particular caste, community, or locality, are committed.\nV. Personality of victim of murder\n\n36. When the victim of murder is (a) an innocent child who could not have or has not provided even an excuse, much less a provocation, for murder, (b) a helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by old age or infirmity, (c) when the victim is a person vis-a- vis whom the murderer is in a position of domination or trust, (d) when the victim is a public figure generally loved and respected by the community for the services rendered by him and the murder is committed for political or similar reasons other than personal reasons.\n[Machhi Singh v State of Punjab.212.]\n\nIt is always preferred not to fetter the judicial discretion by attempting to make excessive enumeration, in one way or another; and that both aspects namely aggravating and mitigating circumstances have to be given their respective weightage and that the Court has to strike the balance between the two and see towards which side the scale/balance of justice tilts.213.\nThe aggravating and mitigating circumstances required to be taken into consideration while applying the doctrine of \"rarest of rare\" crime\n39. Aggravating circumstances:\n\n1. The offences relating to the commission of heinous crimes like murder, rape, armed dacoity, etc. by the accused with a prior record of conviction for capital felony.\n2. The offence was committed while the offender was committing another serious offence.\n3. The offence was committed with the intention to create a fear psychosis in the public at large and was committed in a public place by a weapon or device which clearly could be hazardous to the life of more than one person.\n4. The offence of murder was committed for ransom or like offences to receive money or monetary benefits.\n5. Hired killings.\n6. The offence was committed outrageously for want only while involving inhumane treatment and torture to the victim.\n7. The offence was committed by a person while in lawful custody.\n\n8. The offence was committed to prevent a person lawfully carrying out his duty like arrest or custody in a place of lawful confinement of himself or another. For instance, murder is of a person who had acted in lawful discharge of his duty under section 43, Cr PC, 1973.\n9. When the crime is enormous in proportion like making an attempt of murder of the entire family or members of a particular community.\n10. When the victim is innocent, helpless or a person relies upon the trust of relationship and social norms, like a child, helpless woman, a daughter or a niece staying with a father/uncle and is inflicted with the crime by such a trusted person.\n11. When murder is committed for a motive which evidences total depravity and meanness.\n12. When there is a cold-blooded murder without provocation.\n13. The crime is committed so brutally that it pricks or shocks not only the judicial conscience but even the conscience of the society.\nMitigating circumstances:\n\n1. The manner and circumstances in and under which the offence was committed, for example, extreme mental or emotional disturbance or extreme provocation in contradistinction to all these situations in normal course.\n2. The age of the accused is a relevant consideration but not a determinative factor by itself.\n3. The chances of the accused of not indulging in commission of the crime again and the probability of the accused being reformed and rehabilitated.\n4. The condition of the accused shows that he was mentally defective and the defect impaired his capacity to appreciate the circumstances of his criminal conduct.\n5. The circumstances which, in normal course of life, would render such a behaviour possible and could have the effect of giving rise to mental imbalance in that given situation like persistent harassment or, in fact, leading to such a peak of human behaviour that, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the accused believed that he was morally justified in committing the offence.\n6. Where the Court upon proper appreciation of evidence is of the view that the crime was not committed in a pre-ordained manner and that the death resulted in the course of commission of another crime and that there was a possibility of it being construed as consequences to the commission of the primary crime.\n7. Where it is absolutely unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a sole eye-witness though prosecution has brought home the guilt of the accused.\n40. While determining the questions relatable to sentencing policy, the Court has to follow certain principles and those principles are the loadstar besides the above considerations in imposition or otherwise of the death sentence.\nPrinciples:\n\n(1) The Court has to apply the test to determine, if it was the 'rarest of rare' case for imposition of a death sentence.\n\n(2) In the opinion of the Court, imposition of any other punishment, i.e., life imprisonment would be completely inadequate and would not meet the ends of justice.\n(3) Life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception.\n\n(4) The option to impose sentence of imprisonment for life cannot be cautiously exercised having regard to the nature and circumstances of the crime and all relevant considerations.\n(5) The method (planned or otherwise) and the manner (extent of brutality and inhumanity, etc.) in which the crime was committed and the circumstances leading to commission of such heinous crime.\nRamnaresh v State of Chhattisgarh;214.

In fine, a balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating circumstances has to be drawn up and in doing so the mitigating circumstances have to be accorded full weightage and a just balance has to be struck between the aggravating and mitigating circumstances before the option is exercised to award one sentence or the other.\nThe cardinal questions to be asked and answered are:—\n\n(a) Is there something uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of imprisonment for life inadequate and calls for a death sentence?\n(b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that there is no alternative but to impose death sentence even after according maximum weightage to the mitigating circumstances which speak in favour of the offender?\nIf after taking into consideration all these circumstances, it is felt that death sentence is warranted, the Court would proceed to do so.216. Thus, where murder is premeditated217. or is committed in an organised manner,218. or by a hired assassin219. or by a lawyer220. or where it is gruesome221. or is committed with utmost depravity,222. death sentence seems to be the proper sentence in all such cases."

The circumstances and conditions of life have very seriously changed since then and, therefore, even if those categories are to be observed, some scope for flexibility should always be maintained. Giving a brief view of the changed scenario, the Supreme Court noted that a careful reading of the Machhi Singh categories makes it clear that the classification was made looking at murder mainly as an act of maladjusted individual criminal(s). In 1983, the country was relatively free from organised and professional crime. Abduction for ransom and gang rape and murders committed in course of those offences were yet to become a menace for the society compelling the legislature to create special slots for those offences in IPC, 1860. At the time of Machhi Singh, Delhi had not witnessed the\n\ninfamous Sikh carnage. There had been no attack on the country's Parliament. There were no bombs planted by terrorists killing completely innocent people, men, women and children in dozens with sickening frequency. There were no private armies, no mafia cornering huge Government contracts purely by muscle power, no reports of killings of social activists and \"whistle-blowers\", no reports of custodial deaths and rape and fake encounters by police or even by armed forces. These developments would unquestionably find a more pronounced reflection in any classification if one were to be made today. Relying upon the observations in Bachan Singh, therefore, even though the categories framed in Machhi Singh provide very useful guidelines, nonetheless those cannot be taken as inflexible, absolute or immutable. Further, even in those categories, there would be scope for flexibility as observed in Bachan Singh itself."

It can be safely said that the Bachan Singh threshold of \"the rarest of rare cases\" has been most variedly and inconsistently applied by the various High Courts as also this Court.\n\nThe Judgments which are held to be per incurium in Santhosh Bariyar:\n\n(1) Shivaji @ Dadya Shankar Alhat v State of Maharashtra,225.\n(2) Mohan Anna Chavan v State of Maharashtra,226.\n(3) Bantu v State of UP,227.\n(4) Surja Ram v State of Rajasthan,228.\n(5) Dayanidhi Bisoi v State of Orissa,229. and\n(6) State of UP v Sattan @ Satyendra.230.\n\nIn Sangeet v State of Haryana,231. in an unprecedented Judgment, a two-judge bench of the Supreme Court held that the Court has not endorsed the approach of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in the Constitution Bench Judgment in Bachan Singh and observed that it needs a fresh look. [See the Box with 'Principles summarised in Sangeet's Case by Supreme Court'.] The bench observed that even though Bachan Singh intended \"principled sentencing\", sentencing has now really become judge-centric as highlighted in Swamy Shraddananda and Bariyar. This aspect of the sentencing policy in Phase II as introduced by the Constitution Bench in Bachan Singh seems to have been lost in transition.\nPrinciples summarised in Sangeet's Case by Supreme Court\n\n80. 1. This Court has not endorsed the approach of aggravating and mitigating circumstances in Bachan Singh. However, this approach has been adopted in several decisions. This needs a fresh look. In any event, there is little or no uniformity in the application of this approach.\n2. Aggravating circumstances relate to the crime while mitigating circumstances relate to the criminal. A balance sheet cannot be drawn up for comparing the two. The considerations for both are distinct and unrelated. The use of the mantra of aggravating and mitigating circumstances needs a review.\n\n3. In the sentencing process, both the crime and the criminal are equally important. We have, unfortunately, not taken the sentencing process as seriously as it should be with the result that in capital offences, it has become judge-centric sentencing rather than principled sentencing.\n4. The Constitution Bench of this Court has not encouraged standardization and categorization of crimes and even otherwise it is not possible to standardize and categorize all crimes.\n5. The grant of remissions is statutory. However, to prevent its arbitrary exercise, the legislature has built in some procedural and substantive checks in the statute. These need to be faithfully enforced.\n6. Remission can be granted under Section 432 of the CrPC in the case of a definite term of sentence. The power under this Section is available only for granting \"additional\" remission, that is, for a period over and above the remission granted or awarded to a convict under the Jail Manual or other statutory rules. If the term of sentence is indefinite (as in life imprisonment), the power under Section 432 of the CrPC can certainly be exercised but not on the basis that life imprisonment is an arbitrary or notional figure of twenty years of imprisonment.\n7. Before actually exercising the power of remission under Section 432 of the CrPC the appropriate Government must obtain the opinion (with reasons) of the presiding judge of the convicting or confirming Court.

Mohan Anna Chavan v State of Maharashtra,243. Bantu v State of UP,244. Surja Ram v State of Rajasthan,245. Dayanidhi Bisoi v State of Orissa,246. and State of UP v Sattan @ Satyendra and Others,247. wherein it was held that it is only characteristics relating to crime, to the exclusion of the ones relating to criminal, which are relevant to sentencing in criminal trial, was rendered per incuriam qua Bachan Singh (supra) in the decision reported in Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar (supra) at 529.\n(iv) Public opinion is difficult to fit in the 'rarest of rare' matrix. People's perception of crime is neither an objective circumstance relating to crime nor to the criminal.\n\nPerception of public is extraneous to conviction as also sentencing, at least in capital sentencing according to the mandate of Bachan Singh (supra). [2009 (6) SCC 498 [LNIND 2009 SC 1278] at p 535.]\n(v) Capital sentencing is one such field where the safeguards continuously take strength from the Constitution. [(2009) 6 SCC 498 [LNIND 2009 SC 1278] at 539.]\n(vi) The Apex Court as the final reviewing authority has a far more serious and intensive duty to discharge and the Court not only has to ensure that award of death penalty does not become a perfunctory exercise of discretion under section 302 after an ostensible consideration of 'rarest of rare' doctrine, but also that the decision-making process survives the special rigours of procedural justice applicable in this regard.248.\n(vii) The 'rarest of rare' case comes when a convict would be a menace and threat to the harmonious and peaceful coexistence of the society. The crime may be heinous or brutal but may not be in the category of \"the rarest of the rare case\". There must be no reason to believe that the accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated and that he is likely to continue criminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuing threat to the society.249.\n(viii) Life sentence is the rule and the death penalty is the exception. The condition of providing special reasons for awarding death penalty is not to be construed linguistically but it is to satisfy the basic features of a reasoning supporting and making award of death penalty unquestionable.\n(ix) The circumstances and the manner of committing the crime should be such that it pricks the judicial conscience of the Court to the extent that the only and inevitable conclusion should be awarding of death penalty.\nState of Maharashtra v Goraksha Ambaji Adsul250. and Mohinder Singh v State of Punjab.251."

To award death sentence, the \"crime test\" has to be fully satisfied, that is 100% and \"criminal test\" 0%, that is no Mitigating Circumstance favouring the accused. If there is any circumstance favouring the accused, like lack of intention to commit the crime, possibility of reformation, young age of the accused, not a menace to the society, no previous track record, etc., the \"criminal test\" may favour the accused to avoid the capital punishment. Even if both the tests are satisfied, that is the aggravating circumstances to the fullest extent and no mitigating circumstances favouring the accused, still we have to apply finally the Rarest of Rare Case test (RR Test). RR Test depends upon the perception of the society that is \"society centric\" and not \"Judge centric\", that is, whether the society will approve the awarding of death sentence to certainty types of crimes or not. While applying that test, the Court has to look into variety of factors like society's abhorrence, extreme indignation and antipathy to certain types of crimes like sexual assault and murder of minor girls intellectually challenged, suffering from physical disability, old and infirm women with those disabilities, etc. Examples are only illustrative and not exhaustive. Courts award death sentence since situation demands so, due to constitutional compulsion, reflected by the will of the people and not the will of the judges.252.\nSome Cases where the Court applied the Criminal test to avoid Death Penalty:\n\n(1) Kumudi Lal v State of UP,253.\n(2) Raju v State of Haryana,254.\n(3) Bantu @ Naresh Giri v State of MP,255.\n(4) State of Maharashtra v Suresh,256.\n(5) Amrit Singh v State of Punjab,257.\n(6) Rameshbhai Chandubhai Rathod v State of Gujarat,258.\n(7) Surendra Pal Shivbalak v State of Gujarat,259.\n(8) Amit v State of Maharashtra.260."

But a two-Judge Bench in Sangeet v State of Haryana,262. in which it was held that:\na reading of some recent decisions delivered by this Court seems to suggest that the remission power of the appropriate Government has effectively been nullified by awarding sentences of 20 years, 25 years and in some cases without any remission. Is this permissible? Can this Court (or any Court for that matter) restrain the appropriate Government from granting remission of a sentence to a convict? What this Court has done in Swamy Shraddananda and several other cases, by giving a sentence in a capital offence of 20 years or 30 years imprisonment without remission, is to effectively injunct the appropriate Government from exercising its power of remission for the specified period. In our opinion, this issue needs further and greater discussion, but as at present advised, we are of the opinion that this is not permissible. The appropriate Government cannot be told that it is prohibited from granting remission of a sentence. Similarly, a convict cannot be told that he cannot apply for a remission in his sentence, whatever the reason. In this case, though the Division Bench raised a doubt about the decision of a three-Judge Bench in Swamy Shraddananda (supra), yet the same has not been referred to a larger Bench.\n\nIn Sahib Hussain @ Sahib Jan v State of Rajasthan,263. another two-Judge Bench reiterated the position held in Swamy Shraddananda (supra) by holding that the observations in Sangeet (supra) are not warranted. In Gurvail Singh @ Gala v State of Punjab,264. other two-Judge bench also termed the remarks in Sangeet (supra) as 'unwarranted' and opined that if the two-judge bench was of the opinion that earlier judgments, even of a larger Bench were not justified, the Bench ought to have referred the matter to the larger Bench. However, in some cases, the Court had also been voicing concern about the statutory basis of such orders.265. In a judgment,266. Supreme Court opined that:\nWe are of the view that it will do well in case a proper amendment u/s. 53 of IPC is provided, introducing one more category of punishment—life imprisonment without commutation or remission. Dr. Justice V. S. Malimath in the Report on \"Committee of Reforms of Criminal Justice System\", submitted in 2003, had made such a suggestion but so far no serious steps have been taken in that regard.

In TV Vatheeswaran,271. overruled in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat,272. a two-Judge Bench of Supreme Court considered whether the accused, who was convicted for an offence of murder and sentenced to death, kept in solitary confinement for about eight years was entitled to commutation of death sentence. It was held that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Article 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.273. But a three-Judge bench in Sher Singh v State of Punjab,274. held that though prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed, no hard and fast rule that \"delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke Art. 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death\" can be laid down as has been done in Vatheeswaran (supra). Javed Ahmed v State of Maharashtra,275. re- iterated the proposition laid down in Vatheeswaran (supra) case and doubted the competence of the three-judge bench to overrule the Vatheeswaran case. The conflicting views are finally settled by the Constitution Bench in Triveni Ben v State of Gujarat.276. It overruled Vatheeswaran (supra) holding that undue long delay in execution of the sentence of death will entitle the condemned person to approach the Supreme Court under Article 32 but the Court will only examine the nature of delay caused and circumstances that ensued after sentence will finally be confirmed by the judicial process and will have no jurisdiction to reopen the conclusions reached by the Court while finally maintaining the sentence of death. Court, however, may consider the question of inordinate delay in the light of all circumstances of the case to decide whether the execution of sentence should be carried out or should be altered into imprisonment for life. No fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence of death inexecutable and to this extent the decision in Vatheeswaran's case cannot be said to lay down the correct law. In Madhu Mehta v UOI,277. Supreme Court commuted the death sentence on the ground that the mercy petition was pending for eight years after disposal of the criminal appeal by Supreme Court.\n\nIt is well established that exercising of power under Article 72/161 by the President or the Governor is a constitutional obligation and not a mere prerogative. Considering the high status of office, the Constitutional framers did not stipulate any outer time limit for disposing the mercy petitions under the said Articles, which means it should be decided within reasonable time. However, when the delay caused in disposing the mercy petitions is seen to be unreasonable, unexplained and exorbitant, it is the duty of the Supreme Court to step in and consider this aspect.278."

Sethi, J, of the Supreme Court said that this was not the rarest of rare case. The accused was a misled youth. He was liable to be sentenced to life imprisonment for the major offence of murder.282. In a case arising out of partition between two brothers, one of them (the accused) killed his brother, his wife and children. He was frustrated over his failure to resist partition of joint property. The Court agreed that it was a heinous and brutal crime, but was not in the category of rarest of rare cases. The accused did not have any criminal tendency. He was a State Government employee and not a menace to the society. The Court directed his death sentence to be reduced to 20 years actual imprisonment including the period already undergone.283.\nIn a rape and murder case of an 11-year-old child, there was extra judicial confession made to a senior person to seek his help. He indicated the place where the body of the girl was lying. He struck her in the head twice over with a brick and then in the mouth only when she threatened to disclose. This showed that he had no intention to commit murder and injuries were inflicted only at the spur of the moment. He had no criminal record nor he was in any way a danger to the society. Death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment.284.\nThe Court has to draw a balance between the aggravating and mitigating factors. The accused in this case was the member of a para-military force. He killed seven members of a family in a pre-planned manner. He was 23 at the time and had no criminal record. He and his family members were suffering agony at the hands of the victim family. He had a cause to feel aggrieved for the injustice meted out to his family members.

      "content": "The doctrine of rarest of rare case was enunciated by the Supreme Court in Bachan Singh v State of Punjab.292. The trial Court, High Courts and even the Supreme Court are duty bound to follow it.293. The Court explained in this case some of the relevant factors as follows:\nNot only the doctrine of proportionality but also doctrine of rehabilitation should be taken into consideration, particularly in view of section 354(3), Cr PC, 1973, which must be read with Article 21 of the Constitution. Where there was nothing to show that the appellant-accused could not be reformed and rehabilitated, the mere manner of disposal of the dead body, howsoever abhorrent, should not by itself be regarded sufficient to bring the case in the rarest of rare category. In the present case, all the accused including the appellant were unemployed young men in search of job. They were not criminals. In exception of a plan proposed by the appellant and accepted by them, they kidnapped a friend of theirs with the motive of procuring ransom from his family but later murdered him, and after cutting his body into pieces, disposed of the same at different places. One of the accuseds turned approver and prosecution case was based exclusively on his evidence. Appellant-accused contradicted the approver's version in respect of his role. In such a case, statement of approver regarding manner of murder and role of accused and that of approver himself, should be tested on the basis of prudence doctrine taking into consideration inter alia, evidence produced by the accused for imposition of lesser punishment. Hence, death penalty awarded by the Courts below, in the absence of any special reasons to support the same was substituted by penalty of rigorous imprisonment for life.\nDeath punishment stands on a very different footing from other types of punishments. It is unique in its total irrevocability. Incarceration, life or otherwise, potentially serves more than one sentencing aims. Deterrence, incapacitation, rehabilitation and retribution all ends are capable to be furthered in different degrees, by calibrating this punishment in light of the overarching penal policy. But the same does not hold true of death penalty.294.\nOne has to observe the global move away from the death penalty. Latest statistics show that 138 nations have abolished death penalty in either law or practice (no executions for 10 years).\nFurther, on 18 December 2007, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 62/149 calling upon countries that retain death penalty to establish a worldwide moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty. India is, however, one of the 59 nations that retain the death penalty.295.\nThe Law Commission of India in its Report No. 262 titled \"The Death Penalty\" has recommended the abolition of death penalty for all the crimes other than terrorism related offences and waging war (offences affecting National Security).\nWhere the question of whether death penalty could be imposed in a case which depended upon circumstantial evidence, the Supreme Court said:\nIf the circumstantial evidence is found to be of unimpeachable character in establishing the guilt of the accused, that form the foundation for conviction and that has nothing to do with the question of sentence. Mitigating circumstances and the aggravating circumstances have to be balanced and in the balance sheet of such circumstances. The fact that the case rests on circumstantial evidence has no role to play. In fact, in most of the cases where death sentences are awarded for rape and murder and the like, there is practically no scope for getting an eyewitness. Such offences are not committed in public view. Only available evidence in such cases is\n\ncircumstantial. If such evidence is found to be credible, cogent and trustworthy for the purpose of recording conviction, to treat such evidence as a mitigating circumstance, would amount to consideration of an irrelevant aspect. Hence, such plea is unsustainable. Instant case fell in category of the rarest of rare cases. Circumstances proved established the depraved acts of the accused, and they called for only one sentence, that is, death sentence. Judgment of the High Court, confirming the conviction and sentence imposed by the trial Court, does not warrant any interference.296."

As the deceased was in the custody of the accused and disappeared from their house, the accused did not reveal what happened to the deceased. The Supreme Court held that the accused failed to discharge their duty under section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872. The prosecution is not expected to give the exact manner in which the deceased was killed. Adverse inference needs to be drawn against the accused, as they failed to explain how the deceased was found dead in the river in one-foot deep water.\nReferring to section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, it was propounded that the said section was not intended to relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt, but would apply to cases where prosecution had succeeded in proving facts from which a reasonable inference could be drawn regarding the existence of certain other facts, unless the accused, by virtue of his special knowledge regarding such facts, succeeds in offering any explanation, to drive the Court to draw a different inference.305.\n\nIn Gajanan Dashrath Kharate v State of Maharashtra,306. the deceased was found within the company of the accused and on the next day was found dead. Blood stained dress of the accused with the blood of the deceased was recovered. The Supreme Court held that when an offence like murder is committed in secrecy inside a house, the initial burden to establish the case would undoubtedly be upon the prosecution. In view of section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872, there will be a corresponding burden on the inmates of the house to give cogent explanation as to how the crime was committed.\nWhen the deceased is shown to be abducted, it is for the abductors to explain how they dealt with the abducted victim. In the absence of an explanation, the Court is to draw inference that the abductors are the murderers.307.\nIn the examination under section 313, Cr PC, 1973, the accused denied any knowledge of the crime and alleged false implication. Section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872 imposes an obligation on the accused to explain as to what happened after they were last seen together.308.\nThe mere circumstance that the accused was last seen with the deceased is an unsafe hypothesis to find a conviction on a charge of murder. The lapse of time between the point when the accused was last seen with the deceased and the time of death has to be minimal.309. When the prosecution mainly relies on section 106 of the Evidence Act,1872, the Supreme Court held, in a case where murder took place in a hotel room, that to invoke that section, the main point to be established by the prosecution is that the accused persons were present in the hotel room at the relevant time. In this case, the prosecution failed to produce the CCTV footages available at the hotel where the murder took place, the Court further observed that the CCTV footage being a crucial piece of evidence, it is for the prosecution to have produced the best evidence, which was missing.310.\n\nIn the absence of any persuasive evidence to hold that at the relevant time the appellant was present in the house, it would also be impermissible to cast any burden on him as contemplated under section 106 of the Evidence Act, 1872.311."

Even with the aid of the presumption under section 114 of the Evidence Act, 1872, the charge of murder cannot be brought home unless there is some evidence to show that the robbery and murder occurred at the same time, i.e., in the course of the same transaction.313."

While under section 302, the Court cannot, in its discretion, award sentence lesser than life imprisonment. The ingredients of both these offences, to some extent, are also different inasmuch as to complete an offence of 'dacoity'. Under section 396, IPC, 1860, five or more persons must conjointly commit the robbery while under section 302 of the IPC, 1860 even one person by himself can commit the offence of murder.

The incident was the result of a mistrust created by a payment made by accused to his brother. The court was of the view that it was not a rarest case and death penalty was improper. The court also said that the likelihood of the accused being released prematurely was not a ground for imposing death penalty. The amount of compensation to the victim should not exceed the fine imposed. The only surviving member was the daughter of the deceased. The amount of fine was enhanced from Rs. 5000 to Rs. 20,000.\n217.

The Court also observed that decision would go by comparison of one case with the other, comparison both quantitative and qualitative. The application of the sentencing policy through aggravating and mitigating circumstances came up for consideration in Swamy Shraddananda (2) v State of Karnataka, 2008 (13) SCC 767 [LNIND 2008 SC 1488] : AIR 2008 SC 3040 [LNIND 2008 SC 1488] : 2008 Cr LJ 3911 .

We may add a footnote to the ruling in Rajendra Prasad v. State of U.P., (1979) 3 SCC 646 [LNIND 1979 SC 107] .Taking the clue from the English Legislation on abolition, we may suggest that life imprisonment which strictly means imprisonment for the whole of the man's life, but in practice amounts to incarceration for a period between 10 and 14 years may, at the option of the convicting Court, be subject to the conditions that the sentence of imprisonment shall last as long as life lasts where there are exceptional indications of murderous recidivism and the community cannot run the risk of the convict being at large. This takes care of judicial apprehensions that unless physically liquidated the culprit may at some remote time repeat murder.\" This should be contrasted with Surja Ram v State of Rajasthan, AIR 1997 SC 18 [LNIND 1996 SC 1548] : 1997 Cr LJ 51 , the accused killed his real brother, his two minor sons, and aunt\n\nwhile asleep, also attempted to murder the brother's wife and daughter, deaths caused in cool and calculated manner, rarest, death sentence justified. Bantu v State of MP, AIR 2002 SC 70 [LNIND 2001 SC 2372] : 2002 Cr LJ 211 , the accused was sentenced to death for rape and murder of six-year-old child. He was of 22 years. There was no criminal record. He was not likely to be a grave danger to the society. His act, though heinous and condemnable, did not come in the category of rarest of rare cases. Death sentence was commuted to imprisonment for life. This should be contrasted with Jai Kumar v State of MP, AIR 1999 SC 1860 [LNIND 1999 SC 524]\n: 1999 Cr LJ 2569 . The accused committed a cold-blooded and gruesome and brutal murder of his sister-in-law and her eight-year-old daughter without any provocation. The Court did not regard his age of 22 years as any relevant factor. Death penalty was confirmed. Deepak Kumar v Ravi Virmani, 2002 Cr LJ 1781 (SC) : AIR 2002 SC 1320 [LNIND 2002 SC 1] , death sentence reduced to life imprisonment in a case in which there was heinous killing of four family members.

Another case stressing the need for balancing process is Anil v State of UP, 2002 Cr LJ 2694 (All), the accused had his shop opposite a house. The house owner had the shop closed because of customer nuisance. The accused in revenge got him killed.

      "title": "Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder.",
      "content": "Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with 319.[imprisonment for life], or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine, if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death,\nor with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section provides punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Under it, there are two kinds of punishments applying to two different circumstances:\n(1) If the act by which death is caused is done with intention of causing death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment is imprisonment for life, or imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years and fine.\n(2) If the act is done with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but without any intention to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the punishment is imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both.\nA conviction under Part II of this section read with section 34 is legal and valid. Part II of this section can be read together with section 34, notwithstanding that Part II speaks only of knowledge while section 34 deals with intention.320.\nCommission of the offence of culpable homicide would require some positive act on the part of the accused as distinguished from silence, inaction or a mere lapse. Allegations of not carrying out a prompt search of the missing children; of delay in the lodging of formal complaint with the police and failure to take adequate measures to guard the access from the ashram to the river, which are the principal allegations made in the FIR, cannot make out a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under section 304, IPC, 1860.321."

There are two apparent distinctions, one in relation to the punishment while other is founded on the intention of causing that act, without any intention but with the knowledge that the act is likely to cause death. It is neither advisable nor possible to state any straight-jacket formula that would be universally\n\napplicable to all cases for such determination. Every case essentially must be decided on its own merits. The Court has to perform the very delicate function of applying the provisions of the Code to the facts of the case with a clear demarcation as to under what category of cases, the case at hand falls and accordingly punish the accused.322."

The decision in Harendra Mandal's case,323. was rendered in a different context and observations in the same case cannot be read out of context. That was a case where death itself had not been caused and therefore, question of applying section 304, IPC, 1860 did not arise.324. Section 304, Part II comes into play when the death is caused by doing an act with knowledge that it is likely to cause death but there is no intention on the part of the accused either to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.325."

    "section304.3": {
      "title": "Section 302 or section 304.—Judicial dilemma.—",
      "content": "The Indian Penal Code was enacted in the year 1860 under which the offences within the territory of India have been tried ever since it was enacted dealing with countless number of cases leading either to acquittal or conviction. Yet, the task of the decision- making authorities/Courts of whether an offence of culpable homicide is murder or culpable homicide does not amount to murder in the prevailing facts and circumstances of the case is a perennial question with which the Courts are often confronted. When the evidence discloses a clear case of murder or makes out a finding of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the task of the Courts to record conviction or acquittal is generally an easy one. But this task surely becomes an undaunted one when the accused commits culpable homicide/murder but the circumstances disclose many a times that it is done without premeditation or pre- planning, may be to cause grievous hurt, yet it is so grave in nature that it results into death and the role of the factum causing death without premeditation becomes a secondary consideration due to which the decision of the Courts in such cases often hinges on discretion while considering whether the case would fall under section 302, IPC, 1860 or it would be under section 304, Part I or even Part II, IPC, 1860. On a plain reading of section 299, section 300, section 302 and section 304 of IPC, 1860, it appears that given cases can be conveniently classified into two categories, viz., culpable homicide amounting to murder which is section 302, IPC, 1860 or culpable homicide not amounting to murder which is section 304 IPC, 1860. But when it comes to the actual application of these two sections in a given case, the Courts are often confronted with a dilemma as to whether a case would fall under section 302, IPC, 1860 or would fall under section 304, IPC, 1860. Many a time, this gives rise to conflicting decisions of one Court or the other giving rise to the popular perception among litigants and members of the Bar that a particular Court is an acquitting Court or is a convicting one. This confusion or dilemma often emerges in a case when the question for consideration is whether a given case would fall under section 302, IPC, 1860 or section 304, IPC, 1860 when it is difficult to decipher from the evidence whether the intention was to cause merely bodily injury which would not make out an offence of murder or there was clear intention to kill the victim making out a clear case of an offence of murder.326. Section 300 states both, what is murder and what is not. First finds place in section 300 in its four stated categories, while the second finds detailed mention in the stated five exceptions to section 300. The legislature in its\n\nwisdom, thus, covered the entire gamut of culpable homicide that 'amounting to murder' as well as that 'not amounting to murder' in a composite manner in section 300 of the Code. It is neither advisable nor possible to state any straightjacket formula that would be universally applicable to all cases for such determination. Every case essentially must be decided on its own merits. The Court has to perform the very delicate function of applying the provisions of the Code to the facts of the case with a clear demarcation as to under what category of cases, the case at hand falls and accordingly punish the accused.327. It has been held that unless the case falls under one of the specified exception in section 300, it cannot be brought under Part I or Part II of section 304 of IPC, 1860.328."

    "section304.4": {
      "title": "CASES.—",
      "content": "Where the accused husband suspecting the fidelity of his wife quarrelled with her, poured kerosene on her body and set her on fire and subsequently, when she screamed for help, tried to extinguish fire by pouring water, the Supreme Court held that he was having full knowledge that his act would cause her death and the attempt of extinguishing the fire will not mitigate the offence, hence he was liable under section 302, IPC, 1860 and not under section 304, IPC, 1860.329. The accused followed his daughter into the women's public toilet of the village and assaulted her. The fatal injuries resulted in her instant death. None of the exceptions in section 300 of IPC, 1860 was attracted. It would necessarily follow that the accused committed murder of his daughter. He was liable to be punished with either imprisonment for life or death under section 302, IPC, 1860 alone.330. The accused killed his stepfather, who was an infirm old man and an invalid, with the latter's consent, his motive being to get three innocent men (his enemies) hanged. It was held that the offence was covered by Exception 5 to section 300 and was punishable under the first Part of this section.331. Where the deceased, an old man with an enlarged and flabby heart, was lifted by the accused during a quarrel and thrown on the ground from some distance with sufficient force and the deceased got his ribs fractured and died of a rupture of the heart, it was held that the offence fell under section 325 and not under Part II of this section, as the accused had no intention or knowledge to cause death.332. Accused stabbed the deceased in a sudden incident during an election fever which resulted in his death four days later in hospital where he had been operated upon in a bid to save his life. There was no evidence that the accused intended to cause death or cause such bodily injury as was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death. In the circumstances, it was held that the case fell within clause (b) of section 299 but did not fall within clause 3 of section 300, IPC, 1860, and as such his conviction under section 302 was set aside and he was convicted under section 304, Part I of the Code.333. Similarly, where a young lad of 18½ years old gave only one kassi blow to the deceased following an altercation between his father and the deceased, which resulted in latter's death six days after, it could not be said that he had intended to cause an injury which was sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death within the meaning of clause 3 of section 300, IPC, 1860. He could be at best saddled with knowledge that his act might result in death. His conviction was, therefore, changed from section 302 to section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.334. Accused, in a sudden quarrel gave a blow on the head of his friend with a stick weighing only 210 grams which caused his death. It was held that his conviction under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860, was improper as it could not be said that he had knowledge that such a blow would cause death. His conviction was, therefore, changed to one under section 323, IPC, 1860.335. In a dispute regarding the right of way, the accused gave a single fist blow on the head of the deceased which resulted into his death. No weapon was used, nor was there any past enmity between them. The accused was not held to be responsible for the death of the deceased and\n\nwas sentenced under section 323, IPC, 1860.336. Where a man lifted a four-year-old child and threw him on the ground and thus caused his death, it was held that knowledge of death under section 299, IPC, 1860, could be safely attributed to him and he was therefore liable under section 304, Part-II, IPC, 1860.337. In a sudden quarrel, the accused, a young man, administered a single knife blow on the chest of the deceased causing his death, it was held that the case did not fall under clauses 1 and 2 of section 300 but since he had knowledge that death might follow, he was guilty under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.338. A police officer was punished under Part II of this section with seven-year RI for causing death in custody by resorting to third-degree methods.339. A woman deserted her husband and started living with her paramour six months before the incident. Her fisherman husband, on way back from his work, spotted her sitting among women at outside of a neighbouring house. He approached towards her. On seeing him, she ran inside. He chased and stabbed her to death. His conviction under Part II and sentence of five-year rigorous imprisonment was held to be not excessive.340. A group of persons called out the deceased from his home with a view to lodging a protest but suddenly one of them inflicted a knife wound which falling on the chest killed the deceased. The Supreme Court convicted the single wound- causing accused under this section saying that the heat of passion generated at the spur of the moment and not any intention to cause death was responsible for the incident.341. In another case of the same kind before the Supreme Court, the finding was that the wrestler-accused had an altercation with the deceased two or three days before the incident. The prosecution showed that the accused came to the house of the deceased, but suppressed further knowledge about the incident. Drops of blood in the house showed that the deceased was injured there, ran out and fell dead. There was only one major injury. Conviction under Part I of this section was considered to be appropriate.342. Annoyance was caused by the deceased singing a vulgar song. Quarrel and beating in consequence continued for some time. Accused started beating the deceased with a stick not thick enough to cause rupture of the spleen. He might not have had the intention to cause death but had knowledge that death might result. His conviction under section 300 (second) was converted into one under section 304, Part\nII.343. Where the victim was dragged for about 120 feet and then struck with a crowbar not using much force, the accused knowing that the assault might cause death but not intending it. Part II was held to be attracted and not Part I.344. A person reaching home in a drunken state started beating his wife. Their son intervened and the accused hurled stones on him twice. The boy succumbed to the head injury then and there. Conviction was shifted from under section 302 to 304, Part II, knowledge that death might be caused.345.\n\nPersons exceeding the right of private defence are punished under section 304, Part I and not under section 302.346. Where the deceased died due to the negligent firing by a person, who came for celebrating a marriage function with a gun, it was held that though it is not possible to attribute intention, it is equally not possible to hold that the act was done without the knowledge that it is likely to cause death. Everybody, who carries a gun with live cartridges and even others know that firing a gun and that too in the presence of several people is an act, which is likely to cause death. Hence, the liability under section 304, Part II. The appellant caused the death of his wife by beating her with a wooden stick. No intention to cause death was proved. He was convicted under section 304, Part II.347.\nWhere the death of a player was caused by blowing a cricket stump on him in a friendly cricket match and it was found that the accused player did not know that his act would cause an injury which would cause death or which was likely to cause death, it was held that a conviction under section 304, Part II was not proper, but that an offence under section 325 was made out as the injury was caused by a stump which is a blunt weapon.348.\n\nA married woman (25 years) met a sudden death in her matrimonial home. Her letters and complaints spoke of harassment. The medical report put the cause of death as rupture of spleen and pancreas caused by external pressure. Her husband, who was attempting to escape by resorting to the theory of death by poisoning, was found guilty and his conviction under Part II of this section and sentence of five years of RI was upheld by the Supreme Court. Though he might not have intended to cause death, he did cause an injury about which he must have known that it might cause death.349. Where one of the accused came forward and delivered a blow on the head of a man which proved fatal, the Apex Court was of the view that his act did not attract clause (1) or (3) of section 300 because the accused was armed with no deadly weapon and the head injury was caused by a farmer with an agricultural instrument which he happened to carry with him. Conviction of the accused causing head injury under section 300 was altered to one under section 304, Part II.350. Several persons surrounded a man. Firstly, he was pushed down on the ground and then two injuries were caused to him one each by two assailants one of whom was acquitted. Opinion of the doctor was that the victim died due to shock and haemorrhage resulting from both the injuries. The one injury alone caused by the accused was not individually sufficient to cause death. His conviction was altered from section 300 to that under section 304, Part II.351. Where the accused inflicted a single knife wound in the abdomen of a man which proved fatal and the opinion of the doctor was that, but for complications, the injury was not sufficient to cause death, it was held that the offence did not attract clause (3) of section 300. He was convicted under section 304, Part II.352. A husband, without any history of ill-feeling with his wife, attacked her with the blunt side of an axe and caused a head injury after she fell down of which she died, his conviction under Part I of this section was held to be proper.353. Where a person killed his wife under grave and sudden provocation, a lenient punishment of two years' imprisonment was awarded to him taking into consideration the welfare of his children.354. Where the accused delivered a single stab blow on the chest of his wife out of sheer frustration, momentary impulse and anger, on her refusal to oblige him with sex without any intention to cause her death, his act was held to be culpable homicide not amounting to murder and his conviction was altered from section 302 to section 304, Part I.355.\n\nA pregnant woman went to draw water from a well but she was stopped from doing so by several persons armed with 'lathis' and started abusing her and one of them dealt a 'lathi' blow on her head and another kicked her abdomen, as a result she died on the spot and her son who tried to rescue her was also injured. Looking at the conduct of the accused, it could not be said that they had common object to kill the woman or cause injury to her son. Both the assailants were convicted under section 304, Part II and others were acquitted.356.\nThe death of a young boy was caused in a brutal and cruel manner. The trial Court convicted under sections 302/304. The High Court converted it to section 304 without specifying whether the case fell within Part I or II. Sentence of seven years' imprisonment was imposed. The Supreme Court did not interfere.357."

Where the accused under misapprehension that the deceased came to abduct his daughter attacked the deceased with a sharp-edged weapon, without pre-meditation, causing only one injury and he died after three days, conviction of the accused was altered from under section\n\n300 to one under section 304, Part I.359. Where three accused persons assaulted the deceased, one of the accused gave the fatal blow on the victim's head, the second accused caused simple injuries on the knee and arm with spear, and the third gave simple blows, it was held that the first accused was liable to be convicted under section 304, Part I, and as section 34 was not applicable, the second was convicted under section 324 and the conviction of the third accused under section 323 was upheld.360.\nWhere most of the injuries found on the body of the deceased were external and on lower legs and on arms, it was held that intention of the accused was to cause grievous hurt and not murder.

In a murder case, both the parties sustained injuries in a free fight. The accused received a stab wound on his right shoulder. No explanation of this injury was given by the prosecution. It was held that the accused had caused injuries to the deceased in right of private defence, but that he exceeded his right. He was punished under section 304, Part I and not under section 302.364. In a dispute over possession of land, persons belong to both the sides were injured. The accused were in actual possession at the relevant time. Two of the accused received gunshot injuries. They were held to be entitled to the right of private defence but they exceeded their right. Conviction of the accused under sections 302/149 was altered to one under section 304 Part I.365.

Fighting groups were not close enough so as to apprehend immediate danger to anybody's life, when the firing took place. It was held that the accused had exceeded the right of private defence.

Where the accused received injuries at the hands of the deceased and his party, it was held that the accused were entitled to the right of private defence but by using heavy cutting weapons like 'gandasas' and causing serious injuries to the deceased, they had exceeded the right of private defence and were liable to be punished under section 304, Part I but not for murder.367."

It was held that having regard to the fact that the victim survived for 62 days and that his condition was stable when he was discharged from the hospital, the Court cannot draw an inference that the intended injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death so as to attract clause (3) of section 300 of IPC, 1860. But as the accused used firearms and fired at the victim on his head and he had the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the conviction was altered to section 304, Part I.372."

As there was absence of intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as was likely to cause death, the accused\n\npersons were held guilty for an offence punishable under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 and not for the offence under section 300, IPC, 1860.374."

If a person wilfully drives a motor vehicle into the midst of a crowd and thereby causes death to some person, it will not be a case of mere rash and negligent driving and the act will amount to culpable homicide. Doing an act with the intent to kill a person or knowledge that doing an act was likely to cause a person's death is culpable homicide. When intent or knowledge is the direct motivating force of the act, section 304A has to make room for the graver and more serious charge of culpable homicide.378."

In another hit and run case,380. which killed seven persons and caused injuries to eight persons, the Court held that the case falls under section 304, Part II and not under section 304A by holding that the person must be presumed to have had the knowledge that, his act of driving the vehicle without a licence in a high speed after consuming liquor beyond the permissible limit, is likely or sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death of the pedestrians on the road."

This is because at any stage of the trial, it would have been open to the concerned Court to have altered the charge appropriately depending on the material that is brought before it in the form of evidence.381.\nPermissibility to try and convict a person for the offence punishable under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 and the offence punishable under section 338, IPC, 1860 for a single act of the same transaction. There is no incongruity, if simultaneous with the offence under section 304, Part II, a person who has done an act so rashly or negligently endangering human life or the personal safety of the others and causes grievous hurt to any person is tried for the offence under section 338, IPC, 1860. In view of the above, the Court opined that, there is no impediment in law for an offender being charged for the offence under section 304, Part II IPC, 1860 and also under sections 337 and 338, IPC, 1860. The two charges under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860 and section 338, IPC, 1860 can legally co-exist in a case of single rash or negligent act where a rash or negligent act is done with the knowledge of likelihood of its dangerous consequences.382.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n319.

The case should not be covered by sections 299 and 300 only then it will come under this section. The section provides punishment of either description for a term which may extend to two years or fine or both in case of homicide by rash or negligent act.384.\nEssential ingredients of section 304A are the following:\n\n(i) Death of a person\n(ii) Death was caused by accused during any rash or negligence act.\n(iii) Act does not amount to culpable homicide.\n\nAnd to prove negligence under Criminal Law, the prosecution must prove:\n\n(i) The existence of duty.\n(ii) A breach of the duty causing death.\n  (iii) The breach of the duty must be characterised as gross negligence.385. [s 304A.1] Scope.—\nIn order that a person may be guilty under this section, the rash or negligent act must be the direct or proximate cause of the death.386. The section deals with homicide by negligence."

    "section306.1": {
      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "The ingredients of abetment of suicide are as follows:\n\nThe prosecution has to prove—\n\n(i) the deceased committed suicide;\n(ii) the accused instigated or abetted the commission of suicide;\n(iii) direct involvement by the accused in such abetment or instigation is necessary.577. In Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,578. the Supreme Court held that where the accused by his acts or by a continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option but to commit suicide, an \"instigation\" may be inferred. In other words, in order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be established that\n(a) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased reacted or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward direction, and\n(b) that the accused had the intention to provoke, urge or encourage the deceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly, presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.\nRelevantly, it may be mentioned that there is a marked difference between \"intimidatory\" statement and \"instigatory\" statement. \"Intimidatory\" statements may give rise to two types of consequences, (a) either the person to whom such statements are made may be frightened and may be on receiving end or he may be angry enough to retaliate, whereas (b) instigatory statements falls within the category of goading, provoking, etc.579. Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or\n\nintentionally aiding a person in doing a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.580."

      "content": "Abetment involves a mental process of instigating a person or intentionally aiding a person in doing of a thing. Without a positive act on the part of the accused to instigate or aid in committing suicide, conviction cannot be sustained.581. The intention and involvement of the accused to aid or instigate the commission of suicide is imperative. Any severance or absence of any of this constituents would militate against this indictment. Remoteness of the culpable acts or omissions rooted in the intention of the accused to actualise the suicide would fall short as well of the offence of abetment essential to attract the punitive mandate of section 306, IPC, 1860. Contiguity, continuity, culpability and complicity of the indictable acts or omission are the concomitant indices of abetment. Section 306 IPC, thus criminalises the sustained incitement for suicide.582. In the case of M Mohan v State,583. the Apex Court held that there should be some live link, or a proximate link between the act of the accused and the act of committing of suicide. If the live link is missing, it cannot be said that the accused has instigated, or intentionally aided the commission of suicide. Mere threats of involving the family in a false and frivolous cases cannot be tantamount to instigation.584.\n\nWords uttered in a fit of anger or emotion without any intention could not be regarded as an instigation.585. A type of active role which can be described as amounting to instigation or aiding for doing something is requisite before a person can be said to have committed the offence under the section.586."

If it ends in an attempt, the abetter cannot be convicted. It is possible to abet the commission of suicide. But nobody would abet a mere attempt to commit suicide. It is also inconceivable to have abetment of an abetment. Hence, there cannot be an offence under section 116 read with section 306, IPC, 1860."

The accused husband, a drunkard, always ill-treated his wife, beat her and imputed unchastity. The wife in a quarrel set herself ablaze and died.

Court, on facts, found that the alleged extra-marital relationship was not of such a nature as to drive the wife to commit suicide.593.\nIt has been held that the creation of circumstances for the victim to commit suicide amounts to abetment. In this case, the deceased husband felt humiliated at the activities of indulgence of his wife with the accused. The accused openly spoke of his relationship with the wife of the deceased.

The accused was a superior officer to the deceased. When the deceased failed to comply with the orders of the accused, the accused became very angry and threatened to suspend the deceased, rebuking him very harshly for not listening to him. The accused also asked the deceased how he still found the will to live, despite being insulted so the driver committed suicide. For the purpose of bringing home any charge, vis-à-vis section 306/107 IPC, 1860 against the accused, Supreme Court stated that there must be allegations to the effect that the accused had either instigated the deceased in some way, to commit suicide or had engaged with some other persons in a conspiracy to do so, or that the accused had in some way aided any act or illegal omission to cause the said suicide. If the making of observations by a superior officer, regarding the work of his subordinate, is termed as abetment to suicide, it would become almost impossible, for superior officers to discharge their duties as senior employees. In Vaijnath Kondiba Khandke v State of Maharashtra,606. action was taken against the deceased and his salary was stopped for a month. The Supreme Court held that merely on that count it cannot be said that there was guilty mind or criminal intent to drive a person to commit suicide. That action simplicitor cannot be considered to be pointer against such superior officer for attracting section 306 IPC, 1860, unless the situation is created deliberately so as to drive a person to commit suicide."

There could be cases where the circumstances created by the accused are such that a person feels totally frustrated and finds it difficult to continue existence.612. In Chitresh Kumar Chopra v State (Govt of NCT of Delhi),613. the Supreme Court reiterated the legal position laid down in its earlier three Judges Bench judgment in the case of Ramesh Kumar v State of Chhattisgarh,614. and held that where the accused by his acts or continued course of conduct creates such circumstances that the deceased was left with no other option except to commit suicide, an instigation may be inferred. In order to prove that the accused abetted commission of suicide by a person, it has to be established that:—\n\n(i) the accused kept on irritating or annoying the deceased by words, deeds or wilful omission or conduct which may even be a wilful silence until the deceased reacted; or pushed or forced the deceased by his deeds, words or wilful omission or conduct to make the deceased move forward more quickly in a forward direction; and\n(ii) that the accused had the intention to provoke urge or encourage the deceased to commit suicide while acting in the manner noted above. Undoubtedly, presence of mens rea is the necessary concomitant of instigation.615."

      "title": "Burden of Proof.—",
      "content": "The effect of these new provisions on the matter of burden of proof is amply demonstrated by the decision of the Supreme Court in Gurbachan Singh v Satpal Singh.616. The bride died in her in-laws' home within seven months of her marriage. Evidence ruled out accidental death thus confirming the prosecution version of suicide. As to the question of instigation, Ray J, proceeded as follows:617.\nThe prosecution witnesses clearly testified to the greedy and lustful nature of the husband and others in that they persistently taunted the deceased and tortured her for not having brought sufficient dowry from her father. It is also in evidence that they taunted her for carrying an illegitimate child. All this … caused depression in her mind and drove her to take the extreme step of putting an end to her life by sprinkling kerosene oil on person and setting it afire. Circumstantial evidence (unaccounted delay in providing treatment and informing her parents living not far away) and the evidence of prosecution witnesses clearly proves beyond reasonable doubt that the accused persons instigated and abetted Ravinder Kaur. The findings arrived at by the High Court without considering the circumstantial evidence as well as the evidence of prosecution witnesses cannot be sustained. As such the findings of the High Court are liable to be reversed and set aside.\n\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated in Wazir Chand v State of Haryana618. that before section 306 can be acted upon, there must be clear proof of the fact that the death in question was a suicidal death. In this case the evidence adduced was not able to justify a finding of suicide. The only other possibility was accidental burning of the newly- married woman though she was being victimised for insufficient dowry and there is no chance of an accident being abetted. The husband and in-laws were, however, found guilty under section 498A for causing harassment for dowry."

      "content": "Section 113A was inserted by the Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983, w.e.f.\n26 December 1983. When death takes place within seven years of her marriage, presumption under section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 springs into action. When the question is whether the commission of suicide by a woman had been abetted by her husband or any relative of her husband and it is shown that she had committed suicide within a period of seven years from the date of her marriage and that her husband or such relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty, the Court may presume, having regard to all the other circumstances of the case, that such suicide had been abetted by her husband or by such relative of her husband.619. Section 113A only deals with a presumption which the Court may draw in a particular fact situation which may arise when necessary ingredients in order to attract that provision are established. Criminal law amendment and the rule of procedure was necessitated so as to meet the social challenge of saving the married woman from being ill-treated or forcing to commit suicide by the husband or his relatives, demanding dowry. Legislative mandate of the section is that when a woman commits suicide within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that her husband or any relative of her husband had subjected her to cruelty as per the terms defined in section 498A IPC, 1860, the Court may presume having regard to all other circumstances of the case that such suicide has been abetted by the husband or such person. Though a presumption could be drawn, the burden of proof of showing that such an offence has been committed by the accused under section 498A, IPC, 1860 is on the prosecution.620.\nOnce the prosecution succeeds in establishing the component of cruelty leading to a conviction under section 498A, in our view only in a rare case, the Court can refuse to invoke the presumption of abetment, if other requirements of section 113A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stand satisfied.621."

The Constitutional validity of section 306 (abetment of suicide) has been upheld in a decision of the Bombay High Court also.623. Section 306 constitutes an entirely independent offence.

A casual remark that is likely to cause harassment in ordinary course of things will not come within the purview of instigation.

A would be guilty of murder. A is liable to punishment under this section.\n(b) A, with the intention of causing the death of a child of tender years, exposes it in a desert place. A has committed the offence defined by this section, though the death of the child does not ensue.\n(c) A, intending to murder Z, buys a gun and loads it. A has not yet committed the offence. A fires the gun at Z. He has committed the offence defined in this section, and if by such firing he wounds Z, he is liable to the punishment provided by the latter part of 633.[the first paragraph of] this section.\n(d) A, intending to murder Z by poison, purchases poison and mixes the same with food which remains in A's keeping; A has not yet committed the offence defined in this section. A places the food on Z's table or delivers it to Z's servant to place it on Z's table. A has committed the offence defined in this section.\n\n\n\n(i) that the death of a human being was attempted;\n(ii) that such death was attempted to be caused by, or in consequence of the act of the accused; and\n(iii) that such act was done with the intention of causing death; or that it was done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as:\n(a) the accused knew to be likely to cause death; or\n(b) was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, or that the accused attempted to cause death by doing an act known to him to be so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause (a) death, or\n(b) such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, the accused having no excuse for incurring the risk of causing such death or injury.635.\nTo justify a conviction under this section, it is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted. Although the nature of injury actually caused may often give considerable assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of the accused, such intention may also be deduced from other circumstances, and may even, in some cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to actual wounds. The section makes a distinction between an act of the accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but still there may be cases in which the culprit would be liable under this section. It is not necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of the assault should be sufficient under ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted. What the Court has to see is whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. An attempt in order to be criminal need not be the penultimate act. It is sufficient in law, if there is present an intent coupled with some over act in execution thereof.636. To bring a case within the ambit of section 307, the prosecution has to make out the facts and circumstances envisaged by section 300. If the ingredients of section 300 are wholly lacking, there can be no conviction under section 307.637. The ingredients of the section are (1) intention or knowledge relating to commission of murder; and (2) the doing of an act towards it.638. The Supreme Court held in Pulicherla Nagaraju v State of AP that:\nThe intention to cause death can be gathered generally from a combination of a few or several of the following, among other, circumstances: (i) nature of the weapon used; (ii) whether the weapon was carried by the accused or was picked up from the spot; (iii) whether the blow is aimed at a vital part of the body; (iv) the amount of force employed in causing injury; (v) whether the act was in the course of sudden quarrel or sudden fight or free for all fight; (vi) whether the incident occurs by chance or whether there was any pre- meditation; (vii) whether there was any prior enmity or whether the deceased was a stranger; (viii) whether there was any grave and sudden provocation, and if so, the cause for such provocation; (ix) whether it was in the heat of passion; (x) whether the person inflicting the injury has taken undue advantage or has acted in a cruel and unusual manner; (xi) whether the accused dealt a single blow or several blows. The above list of circumstances is, of course, not exhaustive and there may be several other special circumstances with reference to individual cases which may throw light on the question of intention.639.\n\nIn a group clash, one person died and several others were injured, some of them seriously. The accused also received injuries. Two of the accused were convicted under section 307 and others under section 324. The Supreme Court held that, though the injuries caused by the two accused were somewhat serious, the offence for attempt to murder was not made out as their case stood on the same footing as that of others and altered their conviction to one under section 324.640."

It was held that the intention to cause death could be gathered from the circumstances.643. It is not necessary to constitute the offence that the attack should result in an injury. An attempt is itself sufficient if there is requisite intention.

      "content": "The section makes a distinction between the act of the accused and its result, if any. The Court has to see whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section. Therefore, an accused charged under section 307 IPC, 1860 cannot be acquitted merely because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the nature of a simple hurt.646. It is not essential that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been inflicted in order that the charge under section 307 be made out. It is enough if there is an intention coupled with some common act in execution thereof.647. In Hari Singh,648. the Supreme Court added that:\nthe intention or knowledge of the accused must be such as is necessary to constitute murder. Without this ingredient being established there can be no offence of attempt to murder … The intention is to be gathered from all the circumstances, and not merely from the consequences that ensue.\n\nThe nature of the weapon used, the manner in which it is used, motive for the crime, severity of the blow, and the part of the body where the injury is inflicted, are some of the factors that may be taken into consideration to determine the intention."

The Court held that no offence under section 324 was made out because injuries were caused with a sharp-cutting weapon.651. Where the accused persons had no common intention to kill or have knowledge that death was likely to ensue but only intended to vent their ire against their neighbour for having assaulted their bullocks, when the injuries sustained by the injured persons were simple in nature, the Supreme Court held the accused persons cannot be convicted under section 307 r/w 34.652."

The circumstances that the injury inflicted by the accused was simple or minor will not by itself rule out application of section 307, IPC, 1860.

Considering the fact that the assault was made after some premeditation and pre-planning, considering the fact that assault was carried out in the dead of the night, considering the nature of the weapon, used, nature of the injuries caused, obviously, the present case falls under the ambit of section 307 IPC, 1860 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860.

      "title": "Attempt to commit suicide.",
      "content": "Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year 663.[or with fine, or with both].\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nSuicide by itself is not an offence under either English or Indian Criminal Law, though at one time it was a felony in England.664. It is a unique legal phenomenon in the IPC, 1860 that the only act, the attempt of which alone will become an offence. The person who attempts to commit suicide is guilty of the offence under section 309 IPC, 1860 whereas the person who committed suicide cannot be reached at all. Section 306 renders the person who abets the commission of suicide punishable for which the condition precedent is that suicide should necessarily have been committed.665.\nThe act done must be in the course of the attempt, otherwise no offence is committed. Where a woman with the intention of committing suicide by throwing herself in a well, actually ran towards it, when she was seized by a person, it was held that she might have changed her mind, and she was caught before she did anything which might have been regarded as the commencement of the offence.666. Her act simply amounted to preparation. The pounding of oleander roots with an intention to poison oneself with the same was held not to constitute this offence.667. Where the accused jumped into a well to avoid and escape from police, and when rescued he came out of the well of his own accord, it was held that, in the absence of evidence that he jumped into the well to commit suicide, he could not be convicted of this offence.668. A village woman of 20 years old was ill-treated by her husband. There was a quarrel between the two, and the husband threatened that he would beat her. Late that night the woman, taking her six months' old baby in her arms, slipped away from the house. After she had gone some distance she heard somebody coming up behind her, and when she turned round and saw her husband pursuing her, she got into a panic and jumped down a well nearby with the baby in her arms. The result was that the baby died but the woman recovered. One of the charges against her was attempt to commit suicide. It was held that she should not be convicted under this section of an attempt to commit suicide, for the word \"attempt\" connotes some conscious endeavour to accomplish the act, and the accused in jumping down the well was not thinking at all of taking her own life but only of escaping from her husband.669. If a person openly declares that he will fast to death and then proceeds to refuse all nourishment until the stage is reached when there is imminent danger of death ensuing, he can be held guilty under this section but when the evidence falls short of this, it cannot be said to be sufficient to sustain the charge.670. A woman who had been suffering from chronic incurable disease retired to bed with her one and a half-year-old child but was found with the child inside a well about 200 feet away from her house in the early morning of the next day when they were both taken out of the well, it was found that though the woman was alive the child had died. On being prosecuted under sections 302 and 309 IPC, 1860, she denied\n\nhaving jumped into the well. She further pleaded that she was too ill and there was something wrong with her brain. The trial Judge did not give her the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860 and convicted her of both the offences charged. In acquitting her the High Court of Bombay held that in the absence of any evidence that she deliberately jumped into the well along with the child, she could not be convicted merely on the basis of imagination or denied the benefit of section 84 IPC, 1860. In any case, the Judge should have given her the benefit of doubt.671. Moreover, suspicion however strong is not proof.672. Where a desolate woman jumped into a well with her two children and was released with admonition for the offence under section 309 but was sentenced to imprisonment for three months for the offence under section 307 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court directed that she should also be released with admonition for the offence under section 307 IPC, 1860.673. Witness clearly stated that deceased was shouting, pleading with the accused to not kill her, when accused gave sword blows to her. There is no material available to establish that deceased volunteered herself for death — Exception 5 to section 300 could not be invoked. Conviction and sentence, as recorded by trial Court under sections 302 and 309 of IPC, 1860 against appellant was held proper.674."

It added that the act of attempted suicide has no baneful effect on society and it is also not against religion, morality or public policy, besides suicide or attempt to commit it causes no harm to others.\nThis decision was subsequently reversed and it has been held again that the provision for penalising attempt to commit suicide and abetment of suicide is not unconstitutional.679.\nThe Constitution Bench in a subsequent decision in Gian Kaur v State of Punjab680. and other connected matters has overruled the view taken in the case of P Rathinam681. that section 309 IPC, 1860 is constitutionally invalid. It was held that, on the facts which are not only proved but are also admitted by A1 the acquittal of A1 under section\n\n309, IPC, 1860 has to be set aside and he will have to be convicted under that section.682."

By inverting the presumption against guilt but retaining the provision in the statute book, attempt to suicide is still a criminal offence.

The Court held that the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution does not include the right to die. But in Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug v UOI,685. the Supreme Court held that passive euthanasia can be allowed under exceptional circumstances under the strict monitoring of the Court. The difference between 'active' and passive' euthanasia is that in active euthanasia something is done to end the patient's life while in passive euthanasia, something is not done that would have preserved the patient's life. It is usually defined as withdrawing medical treatment with a deliberate intention to causing the patient's death. In Common Cause (A Regd. Society) v UOI,686. a five-judge Constitution Bench gave legal sanction to passive euthanasia, permitting 'living will' by patients on withdrawing medical support if they slip into irreversible coma.

Preferably one of the three doctors should be a neurologist, one should be a psychiatrist, and the third a physician. For this purpose a panel of doctors in every city may be prepared by the High Court in consultation with the State Government/Union Territory and their fees for this purpose may be fixed. The committee of three doctors nominated by the Bench should carefully examine the patient and also consult the record of the patient as well as taking the views of the hospital staff and submit its report to the High Court Bench.

Where the pregnancy is alleged to have been caused by rape or as a result of failure of a contraceptive used by a married woman or her husband, it would be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman. The termination of a pregnancy by a person who is not a registered medical practitioner will be an offence under the IPC, 1860, which to that extent is modified. It is high time that this section too was suitably amended in terms of Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 (34 of 1971) to include the various other grounds on account of which a pregnancy can now be terminated by registered medical practitioner. In this connection see also comment under section 91 ante. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 does not empower the husband, far less his relations, to prevent the concerned woman from causing abortion if her case is covered under section 3 of that Act. Under section 312 of the IPC, 1860 causing miscarriage is a penal offence. Relevant civil law has since been embodied in the Act legalising termination of pregnancy under certain circumstances. Since law is liberal for effecting such termination, the Act does not lay down any provision on husband's consent in any situation.690.\n1. 'With child' means pregnant, and it is not necessary to show that 'quickening', that is, perception by the mother of the movements of the foetus, has taken place or that the embryo has assumed a foetal form, the stage to which pregnancy has advanced and the form which the ovum or embryo may have assumed are immaterial. Where a\n\nwoman was acquitted on a charge of causing herself to miscarry, on the ground that she had only been pregnant for one month and that there was nothing which could be called foetus or child, it was held that the acquittal was bad in law.691.\nA woman quick with a child simply means a particular stage of pregnancy at which quickening takes place. It is a perception of the woman of the movement of foetus. Section 312 can even apply to a pregnant woman herself who causes her own miscarriage. Good faith by itself is not enough. It has to be good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother or the child and not otherwise. This observation of the High Court of Delhi occurs in a case692. in which the doctor was found to be negligent and careless in injecting needles twice for performing abdominocentesis. The result was that the patient had to undergo forced abortion because septic developed. There was consent only for one insertion and that was not at all applicable to second insertion.\n2. 'Miscarriage' is the premature expulsion of the child or foetus from the mother's womb at any period of pregnancy before the term of gestation is completed."

It is a clear case that accused was instrumental in causing the woman to miscarry and obviously it was not done in good faith for purpose of saving life of deceased.

So far as offence punishable under section 315 of the IPC, 1860 is concerned, the offence is committed by a person who before the birth of any child does any act with the intention of thereby preventing that child from being born alive or causing it to die after its birth, and does by such act prevent that child from being born alive, or causes it to die after its birth, if such act be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother.704. Cognizance taken of the offence under section 315 of IPC, 1860 and the charge framed therein against the petitioner are also not maintainable in view of the fact that no documentary evidence could be collected in course of investigation in support of the allegation that the pregnancy of the prosecutrix was terminated at the instance of the petitioner. She was even not medically examined by the Doctor or the Board of Doctors and there is no medical report in support of the allegation that her pregnancy was ever terminated at any earlier point of time. As the alleged offence under section 315 of the IPC, 1860 relates to termination of pregnancy, such offence may be supported through the medical opinion of the registered practitioner and for want of such prima facie material charge cannot be framed in such section, accordingly the cognizance cannot be taken for the offence under section 315 of the IPC, 1860.705. Intention is one of the major ingredients of sections 315. Wording of section 315 of the IPC, 1860 itself shows that whoever before the birth of any child does any act with the intention of thereby preventing that child from being born alive or causing it to die after its birth, and does by such act prevent that child from being born alive, or causes it to die after its birth, shall, if such act be not caused in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the mother be punished with imprisonment. In this case the patient was admitted for delivery. During course of delivery there was rupture of uterus which led to bleeding and subsequent death of the patient and the child. So, it is not case of any prosecution witness that the respondent deliberately committed offence punishable under section 315 of the IPC, 1860.706.\n\n\n\n\n\n704.

A stab, a blow which fractures a limb, the flinging of boiling water over a person, are assaults, and are also acts which cause bodily hurt. But bodily hurt may be caused by many acts which are not assaults. A person, for example, who mixes a deleterious potion, and places it on the table of another; a person who conceals a scythe in the grass on which another is in the habit of walking; a person who digs a pit in a public path, intending that another may fall into it, may cause serious hurt, and may be justly punished for causing such hurt; but they cannot, without extreme violence to language, be said to have committed assaults. We propose to designate all pain, disease and infirmity by the name of hurt.712.\n\nThe definition of hurt appears to contemplate the causing of pain, etc., by one person to another.

      "title": "Grievous hurt.",
      "content": "The following kinds of hurt only are designated as \"grievous\": First.—Emasculation.\nSecondly.—Permanent privation of the sight of either eye.\n\nThirdly.—Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear, Fourthly.—Privation of any member or joint.\nFifthly.—Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint.\n\nSixthly.—Permanent disfiguration of the head or face. Seventhly.—Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth.\nEighthly.—Any hurt which endangers life or which causes the sufferer to be during the\nspace of twenty days in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nGrievous hurt is hurt of a more serious kind. This section merely gives the description of grievous hurt.\nThe authors of the Code observe:\n\nWe have found it very difficult to draw a line between those bodily hurts which are serious and those which are slight. To draw such a line with perfect accuracy is, indeed, absolutely impossible; but it is far better that such a line should be drawn, though rudely, than that offences some of which approach in enormity to murder, while others are little more than frolics which a good-natured man would hardly resent, would be classed together.717.\n\nTo make out the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, there must be some specific hurt, voluntarily inflicted, and coming within any of the eight kinds enumerated in this section. Where the injury was caused on the abdomen with a sharp-edged weapon and the doctor stated that the injury was penetrating into the abdominal cavity touching the interior surface of the stomach, not involving any important structure or organ involving danger to life, it was held that the accused had caused simple hurt and not grievous hurt.718. A person cannot be said to have caused grievous hurt unless the hurt caused is one of the kinds of hurt specified under section 320, IPC, 1860. Therefore, it is the duty of the Court to give a finding on its own whether the hurt was simple or grievous. The Court is not concerned with the classification made by a doctor\n\nas to whether the hurt was simple or grievous. A doctor is to describe the facts in respect of the nature of injury and the Court is to decide whether the nature of the injury described by the doctor comes within any of the clauses of section 320, IPC, 1860.719."

If there is a break by cutting or splintering of the bone or there is a rupture or fissure in it, it would amount to a fracture within the meaning of this clause.721. It has been held that a mere partial cut of the bone amounts to fracture and is, therefore, a grievous injury within the meaning of section 320 (Seventhly).722."
    },
    "section320.4": {
      "title": "Clause 8.—Endangering life, severe bodily pain, etc.—",
      "content": "This clause speaks of two things: (1) any hurt which endangers life, and (2) any hurt which causes the sufferer to be during the space of 20 days (a) in severe bodily pain, or\n(b) unable to follow his ordinary pursuits. Some hurts which are not like those hurts which are mentioned in the first seven clauses, are obviously distinguished from a slight hurt, may nevertheless be more serious. Thus, a wound may cause intense pain, prolonged disease or lasting injury to the victim, although it does not fall within any of the first seven clauses. Before a conviction for the sentence of grievous hurt can be passed, one of the injuries defined in section 320 must be strictly proved, and the eighth clause is no exception to the general rule of law that a penal statute must be construed strictly.723.\nThe line between culpable homicide not amounting to murder and grievous hurt is a very thin line. In the one case the injuries must be such as are likely to cause death; in the other, the injuries must be such as to endanger life.724.\nAn injury can be said to endanger life if it is in itself that it may put the life of the injured in danger.725.\nThe mere fact that a man has been in hospital for 20 days is not sufficient; it must be proved that during that time he was unable to follow his ordinary pursuits.726. Where the accused caused hurt to a woman who remained in hospital only for 17 days, out of\n\nwhich she was in danger for three days, it was held that he had caused grievous hurt.727. A disability for 20 days constitutes grievous hurt: if it continues for a smaller period, then the offence is hurt.728. The two accused persons tied their victim to an electric pole and assaulted him only to teach him a lesson for spreading scandalous information about the alleged love affair of the accused. Their victim died. There was no evidence to attribute any particular overt act to any of them, nor of the intention of any of them to cause death or that any of them was armed with a deadly weapon. It was held that their offence fell within this clause because they endangered the life of their victim and not under section 300 (murder).729. Where the accused persons, after raping a girl of 11 years, thrust a stick into her private part and she died of injuries thereby caused, it was held that while the accused could be convicted under this clause, in the absence of evidence that the injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, they could not be convicted under section 302.730."

      "content": "Where there is no intention to cause death or no knowledge that death is likely to be caused from the harm inflicted, and death is caused, the accused would be guilty of grievous hurt if the injury caused was of a serious nature, but not of culpable homicide. Where the only intention of the accused who was convicted for the offence of murder was to steal the jewels of the deceased and the only violence which he committed, viz., cutting the nostrils of the deceased, was necessary in order to facilitate the theft and the death of the deceased was entirely unexpected, it was held that the accused was not guilty of murder but of causing grievous hurt under section 325.731. Where the medical evidence showed that the injury on the forehead which caused death was by a lathi and not by an iron rod as deposed to by witnesses and the internal injury could not be correlated to the external injury caused by the accused, it was held to be a fit case where the accused should be convicted only under section 325 IPC, 1860.732. Where the accused acting on a sudden spur of the moment squeezed the testicles of the deceased as a result of which he had a shock resulting in cardiac arrest and sudden death, the Supreme Court came to the conclusion that it was a case falling under the eighth clause of the section, i.e., causing hurt which endangers life. It was a case of grievous hurt punishable under section 325 and not that of simple hurt punishable under section 323.733.

Injuries on different parts of body clearly rules out the theory of sustaining it while falling down on ground. Besides the testimony of injured, the prosecution case has further been corroborated by medical evidence. Record and evidence proved that conspiracy was hatched by accused to apprehend the detenu and others who were demanding his transfer. Accused liable to be convicted under section 323 of IPC, 1860.742. First accused picked up a wooden piece (Pacher) with both the hands and hit on the head of the deceased. On receiving injury, he fell unconscious on the spot. Thereafter, the other accused came running and dealt a blow on the head of PW3. Conviction of first accused under section 304 Part II and co-accused under section 323 IPC, 1860 was held proper.743. Where accused having sticks in their hands entered the house of complainant and assaulted him, the overt act attributed to accused by witnesses is specific, medical evidence fully supports the case of prosecution and accused/respondent is liable to be convicted under section 323 of IPC, 1860.744. The accused, a shopkeeper, in a sudden quarrel hit his wife on the head with an iron weight of 200 grams which resulted in her death. The medical evidence showed that the injury was of a simple nature and there was no evidence that the deceased died of shock caused by the injury. He was held liable only under section 323 IPC, 1860 and not under section 304 IPC, 1860.745. So also where the wife attacked the husband with a brick causing multiple injuries resulting in his death but according to medical evidence the injuries were of a simple nature and were not sufficient in ordinary course of nature to cause death, it was held that the accused wife could not be convicted under section\n\n302 IPC, 1860. Her conviction was accordingly changed to one under section 323 IPC, 1860.746.\nThe accused pushed the victim. She fell down and sustained injuries of simple nature. This act of the accused was held to fall under section 323.747. Where the accused gave a push on the chest of the deceased and the victim fell on a stone resulting in death, conviction was recorded under section 323.748. The accused husband returned home at midnight in a drunken state. He beat his wife and threw a piece of stone on her head and she died. The post-mortem report revealed three simple injuries on her head and exact cause of death could not be ascertained. Relations between the accused and the deceased were found to be cordial. Intention to cause the victim's death was not proved. Conviction of the accused under section 300 was set aside and he was convicted under section 323.749. Several persons attacked and caused the death of their victim. All, including the present appellant, were holding the deceased and one of them K dealt fatal blows. K was convicted of murder under section 302. All his fellows were convicted under this section read with section 149 except the present appellant who was convicted under section 302 read with section 34. The Supreme Court held that the appellant should also have been convicted under this section read with section 149.750. Thomas v State of Kerala,751. the fist blow caused by the accused resulted in subdural haematoma which led to the death of the victim, but it could not be said that the accused could be attributed with the knowledge that by such act he was likely to cause death, nor could it be said that the accused intended to cause that particular injury which he actually caused, it was held that accused could be convicted only under section 323 and not section 300. In Mohan Singh v State of Rajasthan,752. the accused attacked his victim and caused voluntary hurt to him by inflicting fist blows and causing nose injury. His guilt was established by the evidence of the witnesses. The plea of alibi raised by the accused was not tenable. His conviction under section 323 was upheld.\nWhere the offence was punishable under this section and also under sections 304, Part II/34, and was covered by the Uttar Pradesh Children Act, 1951, the Court did not consider it proper to subject children to imprisonment but, looking at the brutal nature of the offence, imposed a sentence of fine.753.\nWhere the accused brothers chanced to converge, having not met before, at their sister's place avowedly to teach her a lesson for having instituted proceedings against them and one of them who, not known to others was carrying a knife, inflicted a knife blow which, landing on a vital part, caused death, they were convicted under this section and the knife wielding brother under section 304 Part-II.754. In a case of attempt to murder, one of the accused gave only one blow with a 'lathi' on the shoulder of the injured without sharing the common intention of the other accused. Injury was simple and caused only swelling. He was convicted for his individual act under section 323 and was released on probation.755."

The injury to the testicles was not the direct cause of his death. The Supreme Court set aside his conviction under section 304 Part II and convicted him under section 323 instead.757.

      "content": "Where the accused gave a blow on the left side of the head of the victim with a Farsha, a sharp-cutting weapon, causing a simple scalp-deep injury and there was the possibility that the sharp edge of the weapon was not used, it was held that his conviction should be changed from section 307 to one under section 324 IPC, 1860 since Farsha is a weapon which if used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death.766. Where a head injury was caused with a deadly weapon and the injured was discharged from the hospital after 15 days, but six months thereafter he had to be hospitalised again for brain operation and he did not recover, the death being not solely due to the injury, the accused persons convicted under this section and their conviction under section 304 was set aside.767. Tooth is an instrument of cutting and as such biting off the tip of the nose would be an offence under this section or section 326 IPC, 1860 depending on the nature of the injury, simple or grievous.768. Where there is no serious injury on any vital part of the body of the victim, the offender should be convicted under section 324 and not under section 326 IPC, 1860.769. Thus, where the accused inflicted an injury on the right shoulder of the deceased with a broken soda water bottle with sharp edges without knowing that the deceased was suffering from haemophilia (tendency of excessive bleeding), it was held that the accused was liable only under section 324 and not under section 302 IPC, 1860.770. Where simple injuries not likely to cause death were inflicted with a sword, the Supreme Court transferred the conviction from under section 307 to one under this section and allowed the offences to be compounded on payment to the victim a sum of Rs. 3,000.771. Where in a case of a dowry death, the evidence showed that the accused, mother-in-law caused injuries on\n\nthe person of the daughter-in-law. She committed suicide. The accused was punished under section 324 but on consideration of circumstances and facts that she was 80, only a sentence of fine of Rs. 3,000 was imposed. Offence under section 306 was not made out.772. Where the accused, a boy of 18 years of age at the time of incident having no criminal history, in a sudden scuffle gave a blow on the chest of the deceased with an ordinary knife resulting in his death and thereafter, mutely allowed to take the knife from his hand and went to the hospital along with the deceased, it was held that he had no intention to cause death or grievous hurt to the deceased, and was guilty under section 324 and not under section 304, Part II.773. Where the accused assaulted his victim by 'Katti' blow causing grievous hurt and the co-accused assaulted the victim only by lathis and hands causing minor injuries and no pre-concert between the accused and the co-accused regarding the assault by the 'Katti' was established, it was held that the co-accused could not be vicariously held liable for the acts of the accused and be convicted under section 324.774. Where a blow was inflicted with the blunt side of the axe on the thigh of the victim, the Supreme Court reduced the sentence to four months' RI and increased the fine to Rs. 3,000.775. Where the accused deliberately attacked and killed a person with a deadly weapon and was held to be rightly convicted for murder under section 300, he was convicted under this section and sentenced to pay a fine for causing hurt on the hand of the intervening wife of the deceased with a rice pounder.776.\n\nIn a free fight between two groups resulting in death of one person and injuries to several others, fatal injury could not be attributed to any one of the accused who also received a number of injuries. It was held that the accused were properly convicted under sections 324 and 325.777. Where one of the accused caused two gunshot injuries to a man which proved fatal, the other accused caused him only an incised injury. The accused causing fatal injuries was sentenced under section 302 and the other accused only under section 324.778. In an altercation the accused dealt a blow with spade lying on the spot on the head of a 70-year-old man who became unconscious, was hospitalised and died after three weeks. The blow caused only linear fracture of left frontal bone. It was found that essential element of voluntarily causing grievous hurt was wanting. It was held that his offence fell under section 324 and not under section 326.779. Allegation that accused resorted to repeated firings at two persons on two occasions at two different times and place. On first occasion accused fired in air and pellets after being ricocheted from ceiling caused simple injuries to three persons. On second occasion also appellant had not caused any injury to anybody. In view of dearth of convincing evidence on record, it cannot be concluded with any degree of certainty that appellant had an intention to commit murder of anybody. Only conclusion could be drawn is that appellant wanted to cause hurt for dispersing crowd. Appellant can only be convicted under section 324 of IPC, 1860 and not under section 307 IPC, 1860.780. Medical evidence that injuries, however, serious in nature but not grievous in nature. Skin grafting has been done and victim is fit for discharge — Accused is guilty of offence under section 324 IPC, 1860 and not under section 307 IPC, 1860.781. The accused struck his wife once only on the neck causing simple injury. She fell down and was further injured and died. The instrument (wooden reaper) was dangerous. The conviction was altered from under section 304, Part II to section 324.782."

Where the injured witness himself attributed the injury on him to the deceased, instead of the accused, the conviction of the accused on the charge of section 324 cannot be sustained under law.785. Where no explanation by prosecution as to how the injuries were caused to deceased and the role attributed to appellants by prosecution is fully covered by their right of private defence, conviction and sentence is liable to be set aside.786. In a case, the allegation was that the accused petitioner inflicted simple and grievous injuries with sharp-edged weapon on person of victim.

The Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment Act) 2005 (Act 25 of 2005) has taken out section 324 of IPC, 1860 from the sphere of compounding and thereby made it non- compoundable. Since the offence committed under section 324 of IPC, 1860 before Amendment Act came into force, was compoundable with the permission of the Court pursuant to the provisions prescribed under sub-section (2) of section 320 of Cr PC, 1973—as was in force before the Code of Criminal Procedure Amendment Act 2005 came into effect.790. After coming into force of the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act 2005 the offence under section 324, IPC is made non- compoundable. However, in this case the offence under section 324, IPC was committed on 23 July 1986 on which date it was compoundable with the permission of the Court. As the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment Act) 2005 is not applicable to the facts of the case, the offence under section 324, IPC, 1860 would be compoundable with the permission of the Court.791."

      "content": "Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, voluntarily causes grievous hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section prescribes the punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt except in cases provided for by section 335. The facts involved in a particular case, depending upon various factors like size, sharpness, would throw light on the question whether the weapon was a dangerous or deadly weapon or not. That would determine whether in the case section 325 or section 326 would be applicable. Considering the size of the stone which was used, as revealed by material on record, it cannot be said that a dangerous weapon was used. Therefore, the conviction was altered to section 325 IPC, 1860.793. Where a player in a friendly cricket match blew a stump against another player which hit his head and caused death, it was held that the intention to cause death or likelihood of it being not proved, an offence under section 325 was made out, injury having been caused by a blunt weapon.794. Where medical evidence showed that attack on the forehead of the deceased was by a lathi and the internal injury could not be correlated to the external injury caused by the accused, it was held that the accused was liable under section 325 IPC, 1860 and not under section 304, Part II, IPC, 1860.795. Where two injuries were caused in a quarrel by the two accused persons each of whom inflicted one stick blow one of which proved fatal but it could not be known who had inflicted that blow and since intention to cause death was not established, conviction was altered from under section 302 to section 325 read with section 34.796. In a fight between two groups, one person received one stick blow on the head and died a week after treatment and operation. It could not be said that the accused had knowledge that blow would cause death of that person. Conviction of the accused under section 304 Part II/34 was altered to one under sections 325 and 34.797. In an altercation between father and the son, the son gave a blow on the head of his father with a heavy stick and ran away. The victim died after one week in the hospital. It was held that the attack was not pre-meditated and the offence fell under section 325 and not under section 302.798. In a case the victim had sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the body and the injury was life threatening, imposition of sentence of six days only, which was the period already undergone by the accused in confinement was held too lenient. However, as the parties had forgotten their differences and were living peacefully for 25 years, the Court taking into consideration the aggravating as well as mitigating factors under the facts of this case, imposed a sentence of six months' rigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.799. In a clash over property dispute the accused party caused grievous injuries to two persons and simple injuries to some\n\nothers. The occurrence took place 17 years before and some of the accused were more than 76 years of age and one of them had died. Their conviction under section 325 was affirmed but the sentence was reduced to the period already undergone as the Court did not think it fit to send them back to jail. However, a fine of Rs. 200 was imposed on each one of them.800. In this connection, see also discussion and cases under sub- heads \"Death caused without requisite 'intention or knowledge' not culpable homicide\" and \"single blow or lathi blow\" under section 299, ante.801."

So far as jail sentence is concerned, it may extend up to 7 years as per court's discretion whereas so far as fine amount is concerned, its quantum would also depend upon the Court's discretion.802. Where the victim sustained a grievous injury on a vital portion of the body, i.e., the head, which was fractured and the injury was life threatening, imposition of the sentence of six days only which was the period already undergone by the accused in confinement was held too lenient. The Supreme Court considering the aggravating as well as mitigating factors under the facts that the parties have forgotten their differences and are living peacefully imposed a sentence of 6 months' RI and a fine of Rs. 25,000/- against the accused.803."

      "title": "Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means.",
      "content": "Whoever, except in the case provided for by section 335, voluntarily causes grievous hurt by means of any instrument for shooting, stabbing or cutting, or any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, or by means of fire or any heated substance, or by means of any poison or any corrosive substance, or by means of any explosive substance, or by means of any substance which it is deleterious to the human body to inhale, to swallow, or to receive into the blood, or by means of any animal, shall be punished with 805.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThe relationship between this section and the preceding one is the same as that between sections 324 and 323. Before a conviction for the sentence of grievous hurt can be passed, one of the injuries defined in section 320 must be strictly proved, and the eighth clause is no exception to the general rule of law that a penal statute must be construed strictly. The expression \"any instrument which, used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death\" has to be gauged taking note of the heading of the section.\nThe essential ingredients to attract section 326 are:\n\n(1) voluntarily causing a hurt;\n(2) hurt caused must be a grievous hurt; and\n(3) the grievous hurt must have been caused by dangerous weapons or means.806."

      "title": "Dangerous weapon.—",
      "content": "What would constitute a 'dangerous weapon' would depend upon the facts of each case and no generalisation can be made. The heading of the section provides some insight into the factors to be considered. As was noted by the Supreme Court in State of UP v Indrajeet alias Sukhatha,807. there is no such thing as a regular or earmarked weapon for committing murder or for that matter a hurt. Whether a particular article can per se cause any serious wound or grievous hurt or injury has to be determined factually. At this juncture, it would be relevant to note that in some provisions, e.g., sections 324 and 326 expression \"dangerous weapon\" is used. In some other more serious offences the expression used is \"deadly weapon\" (e.g., sections 397 and 398). The facts involved in a particular case, depending upon various factors like size, sharpness, would throw light on the question whether the weapon was a dangerous or\n\ndeadly weapon or not. That would determine whether in the case section 325 or section 326 would be applicable.808.\nIn the absence of any evidence that the stick which was used as a weapon of offence was of lethal type and something like sharp blade or sharp point, etc., was attached to it, the stick was held to be not an instrument within the meaning of this section.809. Where the accused-teacher assaulted the child-student with a wooden stick that caused injury to the eye of the child but there was no material to show that the stick that was wielded by the accused was a dangerous weapon, the conviction of the accused under section 326 may not be warranted; but the offence would fall under section 325 IPC, 1860.810."

The Court said that at the highest, the accused persons could be said to be guilty under sections 326/34 for causing grievous hurt.811. In an altercation the accused persons beat the injured with fist and leg blows on stomach and waist. An attempt was made to help him out of the injury by fomenting at home. But he had to be shifted to hospital and operated upon. It was held that the accused was guilty of attempt to cause grievous hurt and not attempt to murder.812. The accused persons armed with lathis and a tangi went to the field of the victims and picked up a fight while they were ploughing their field. Looking at the attack they ran away. On their way back they met the uncle of their victims who happened to ask them about the matter. They being annoyed by the question, hit him on the head with a lathi. He died.

A bare perusal of these two provisions clearly reveals that while section 307 IPC, 1860 uses the words \"under such circumstances\", these words are conspicuously missing from section 326 IPC, 1860. Therefore, while deciding whether the case falls under section 307 IPC, 1860 or under section 326 IPC, 1860 the Court must necessarily examine the circumstances in which the assault was made.827. Doctor categorically stated that injury could have caused death. Radiologist also stated that chopping of the leg was grievous act in nature. The Supreme Court held that High Court was not justified in altering conviction from section 307 read with section 149 to 326 read with section 149 IPC, 1860.828. Number of injures were quite grievous but accused were careful not to give any blow on any vital part of body. Doctor did not say that injuries were sufficient in the course of nature to cause death.

Supreme Court allowed the compounding of an offence under section 326 IPC, 1860 even though such compounding was not permitted by section 320 of the Code. However, in Surendra Nath Mohanty v State of Orissa,835. and in Ramlal v State of Jammu and Kashmir,836. it was held that an offence which law declares to be non-compoundable cannot be compounded at all even with the permission of the Court and held Suresh Babu,837. per incuriam. In Jalaluddin v State of UP,838. and in Bankat v State,839. the Apex Court reiterated that as the offence under section 326, IPC, 1860 is not compoundable, even if the parties settled the matter. In Ramgopal v State of MP,840. Supreme Court held as follows:\nThere are several offences under the IPC that are currently non - compoundable. These include offences punishable u/s. 498-A, s. 326, etc. of the IPC. Some of such offence can be made compoundable by introducing a suitable amendment in the statute. We are of the opinion that the Law Commission of India could examine whether a suitable proposal can be sent to the Union Government in this regard. Any such step would not only relieve the Courts of the burden of deciding cases in which the aggrieved parties have themselves arrived at a settlement, but may also encourage the process of reconciliation between them. We, accordingly, request the Law Commission and the Government of India to examine all these aspects and take such steps as may be considered feasible.\n\nThe Law Commission of India examined the issue in view of the direction in Ramgopal's Case and submitted its 237th Report suggesting to make section 498A and section 324 compoundable: no changes were suggested regarding section 326. In Gian Singh v State of Punjab,841. a three-Judge Bench held that sub-section (9) of section 320 mandates that no offence shall be compounded except as provided by this section. Obviously, in view thereof the composition of an offence has to be in accord with section 320 and in no other manner. But the power of compounding of offences given to a Court under section 320 is materially different from the quashing of criminal proceedings by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. In compounding of offences, power of a criminal Court is circumscribed by the provisions contained in section 320 and the Court is guided solely and squarely thereby while, on the other hand, the formation of opinion by the High Court for quashing a criminal offence or criminal proceeding or criminal complaint is guided by the material on record as to whether the ends of justice would justify such exercise of power although the ultimate consequence may be acquittal or dismissal of indictment. The result is, though section\n326 IPC, 1860 is a non-compoundable offence, the High Court can quash the\n\n\n\n\n\n805.

Going by section 214 Cr PC, 1973 in every charge words used in describing an offence shall be deemed to have been used in the sense attached to them by law under which such offence is punishable. Therefore, to construe the section relating to culpable homicide as only an error for causing hurt by unwholesome drug will lead to be misleading so far as the accused is concerned resulting in failure of justice so far as his opportunity to defend is concerned.854.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n850.

      "title": "Custodial Torture.—",
      "content": "Though sections 330 and 331 of the IPC, 1860 make punishable those persons who cause hurt for the purpose of extorting the confession by making the offence punishable with sentence up to 10 years of imprisonment, but the convictions, as experience shows from track record have been very few compared to the considerable increase of such onslaught because the atrocities within the precincts of the police station are often left without much traces or any ocular or other direct evidence to prove as to who the offenders are. Disturbed by this situation the Law Commission in its 113th Report recommended amendments to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 so as to provide that in the prosecution of a police officer for an alleged offence of having caused bodily injuries to a person while in police custody, if there is evidence that the injury was caused during the period when the person was in the police custody, the Court may presume that the injury was caused by the police officer having the custody of that person during that period unless the police officer proves to the contrary. The onus to prove the contrary must be discharged by the police official concerned. Keeping in view the dehumanising aspect of the crime, the flagrant violation of the fundamental rights of the victim of the crime and the growing rise in the crimes of this type, where only a few come to light and others don't, the Government and the legislature must give serious thought to the recommendation of the Law Commission and bring about the appropriate changes in the law not only to curb the custodial crime but also to see that the custodial crime does not go unpunished. The Courts are also required to have a change in their outlook approach, appreciation and attitude, particularly in cases involving custodial crimes and they should exhibit more sensitivity and adopt a realistic rather than a narrow technical approach, while dealing with the cases of custodial crime so that as far as possible within their powers, the truth is found and guilty should not escape so that the victim of the crime has the satisfaction that ultimately the majesty of law has prevailed.861.\nWhere daughter of accused and son of complainant married each other. Complainant and his family members were brutally tortured by police officials it was held that order framing charge against petitioner was proper.862.\nWhere the accused, the investigating officer and his assistant, entertained suspicion about two persons in a case of theft and subjected the suspects to ill-treatment to extort confession or information leading to detection of stolen properties, the accused were held guilty of offence under section 330.863."

The hurt caused under it must be grievous. Where the accused gave fist blow on the face of the victim which caused loosening of one tooth, but the victim was discharged from the hospital on the same day, moved about throughout the day and attended his duties the next day, it was held that the injury could not be regarded as grave and serious. It was a case of simple hurt.874. The basic differences between sections 333 and 325 IPC, 1860 are that section 325 gets attracted where grievous hurt is caused, whereas section 333 gets attracted if such hurt is caused to a public servant.875.\n\nComplainant had sustained grievous hurt while he was on patrolling duty. He was questioning the unauthorised parking of a pickup van. He was taken inside the van then kicked and punched. Witnesses corroborated each other on material particulars. Conviction was upheld.876.

The word \"rashly\" means something more than mere inadvertence or inattentiveness or want of ordinary care; it implies an indifference to obvious consequences and to the rights of others.885. An intentional act done with consideration cannot be a rash and negligent act.886.\nMany specific acts of rashness or negligence likely to endanger life or to cause hurt or injury are made punishable by Chapter XIV.\nSection 279 punishes rash driving or riding; section 280, rash navigation of a vessel; section 284, rash or negligent conduct with respect to poisonous substance; section 285, rash or negligent conduct with respect to any fire or combustible matter; section 286, rash or negligent conduct with respect to any explosive substance; section 287, negligent conduct with respect to any machinery in the possession of the accused; section 288, negligence with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings; section 289, negligence with respect to animals; section 304A, rash or negligent act causing death; section 336, any rash or negligent act endangering life or personal safety of others; section 337, rash or negligent act causing hurt; and section 338, rash or negligent act causing grievous hurt. Like section 304A, sections 279, 336, 337 and 338 IPC, 1860 are attracted for only the negligent or rash act. The scheme of sections 279, 304A, 336, 337 and 338 leaves no manner of doubt that these offences are punished because of the inherent danger of the acts specified therein irrespective of knowledge or intention to produce the result and irrespective of the result. These sections make punishable the acts themselves which are likely to cause death or injury to human life.\n\n885. Remal Dass, (1963) 2 Cr LJ 718 .\n886.

The essential ingredients of section 337, IPC, 1860 are that whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life, or the personal safety of others, shall be punished. So, one of the essential ingredients of this section must be that hurt must be caused to someone in doing an act and the person bearing to take reasonable care is said to be negligent of his act.887. This section applies only to acts done rashly or negligently but without any criminal intent. But such negligence or rashness must be proved as would necessarily carry with it criminal liability.888. Where the victim suffered only simple injuries, section 337 is to be applied.889."

These sections make punishable the acts themselves which are likely to cause death or injury to human life. The question is whether indictment of an accused under section 304 Part II and section 338 IPC, 1860 can co-exist in a case of single rash or negligent act. It can, two charges are not mutually destructive. If the act is done with the knowledge of the dangerous consequences which are likely to follow and if death is caused then not only that the punishment is for the act but also for the resulting homicide and a case may fall within section 299 or section 300 depending upon the mental state of the accused viz., as to whether the act was done with one kind of knowledge or the other or the intention. Knowledge is awareness on the part of the person concerned of the consequences of his act of omission or commission indicating his state of mind. There may be knowledge of likely consequences without any intention. Criminal culpability is determined by referring to what a person with reasonable prudence would have known.903."

They apply to different situations for different purposes and for different measures to be taken by the owner or occupier of the factories. Even the steps to be taken under both the enactments are different as discussed above, and even if no fire accident had taken place, the provisions of Factories Act, 1948 and the Fire Services Act will apply. But when there is no accident, section 337 and section 338, IPC, 1860 do not apply. Sections 337 and 338, IPC, 1860 are applicable where the owner or occupier, knowing very well that no preventive steps were taken and it will be dangerous for the workers to work in such a situation and without any due regard to the consequences which a man would think and for the safety of the workers, extract work from them and wherein from the circumstances it appears that such an act of extracting work from workers amount to acting in rash and negligent manner.

A wrongfully restrains Z.\n(c) A threatens to set a savage dog at Z, if Z goes along a path along which Z has a right to go. Z is thus prevented from going along that path. A wrongfully restrains Z.\n(d) In the last illustration, if the dog is not really savage, but if A voluntarily causes Z to think that it is savage, and thereby prevents Z from going along the path, A wrongfully restrains Z.\nFrom these illustrations it will appear that a person may obstruct another by causing it to appear to that other that it is impossible, difficult or dangerous to proceed, as well as by causing it actually to be impossible, difficult or dangerous for that other to proceed. For the offence of wrongful restraint, the necessary pre-condition is that the person concerned must have a right to proceed.911. It is an inevitable factor under section 339 of the IPC, 1860 which defines wrongful restraint that the person, who is obstructed, has the right to proceed in a particular direction. If section 339 and section 31 are read together, it will be clear that if the accused voluntarily obstructs any person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has right to proceed, he is said to have wrongfully restrained that person. Section 339 of the IPC, 1860 requires that the accused should have obstructed a person from proceeding in any direction in which he has the right to proceed and when he obstructs any person and restrains him from proceeding in any direction he commits the offence of wrongful restraint punishable under section 341 of the IPC, 1860.912. Whoever obstructs a person from proceeding to a direction to which that person has a right to proceed, commits an offence of wrongful restraint. While dealing with the offence which is punishable under section 341 of IPC, 1860 and which has been defined by section 339 of IPC, 1860 the Court is obliged to see following ingredients:\n\n(1) Whether the person so obstructed had a lawful right to proceed to a direction to which he has been obstructed;\n(2) Whether such obstruction was for enforcement of a legal right of the obstructer.\n(3) Whether such obstructer obstructed such person in good faith. It has to be kept in mind that nothing can be said to be done in good faith which is not done with due care and caution. If these ingredients are indicated by the complaint, the Magistrate is obliged to take the cognizance of the complaint so presented before him unless there are the other grounds for acting otherwise which has to be justified by reasons recorded in writing.913.\nWhere the tenant and his family members were prevented by some other tenants in league with the landlord from using the main gate by force and abuses, the Court observed that it was utterly wrong to have dismissed the complaint as a matter of civil nature.914.\nObstruction contemplated by this section, though physical, may be caused not only by physical force but also by menaces and threats, the criterion of the offence thereunder or under section 341 being more the effect than the method.915. The fact of physical obstruction even by mere words would fall within the ambit of this section.916."

Where at the behest of a constable the accused stopped some carts in which rice was being carried by some persons in the bona fide belief that the rice was being smuggled out, they could not be held liable under section 341, IPC, 1860 even if suspicion ultimately proved to be incorrect, for they would still get the protection of section 79, IPC, 1860 that is, mistake of fact.922. Where a tenant was partially obstructed from entering the premises by the closure of one of the door leaves, it was held that it did not amount to wrongful restraint as he was still free to enter the premises.923. The wife of the complainant was working as a teacher in a school. The complainant, a judicial officer, was staying in the quarter allotted to her in the school compound till he was posted to some other place.

He was not restrained from using the passage leading to the school premises where his wife was allotted residential quarter. It was held that criminal restraint to a 'person' is punishable but not any obstruction for plying/parking of a vehicle at a particular place.924.

A is thus prevented from proceeding in any direction beyond the circumscribing line of wall. A wrongfully confines Z.\n\n(b) A places men with firearms at the outlets of a building, and tells Z that they will fire at Z if Z attempts to leave the building. A wrongfully confines Z.\n\n\n\nbecomes wrongful if such restraint is not in exercise of any right, power or authority under any law.930.\n1. 'Prevent that person from proceedings'.—The restraining of a person in a particular place or compelling him to go in a particular direction by force of an exterior will overpowering or suppressing in any way his own voluntary action is an imprisonment on the part of him who exercises that exterior will.931. There can be no wrongful confinement when a desire to proceed has never existed, nor can a confinement be wrongful if it was consented to by the person affected.932. Mere insistence by words of mouth or mere sitting around a person would not satisfy the requirements of the offence of wrongful confinement which requires that there must be voluntary obstruction to that person so as to prevent that person from proceeding in any direction in which that person has a right to proceed.933. To support a charge of wrongful confinement proof of actual physical restriction is not essential. It is sufficient if such evidence shows that such an impression was produced on the mind of the victim as to create a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that he or she was not free to depart and that he or she would be forthwith seized or restrained if he or she attempted to do so.934.\n2. 'Certain circumscribing limits'.—\n\nA prison may have its boundary, large or narrow, visible and tangible, or, though real still in the conception only; it may itself be moveable or fixed: but a boundary it must have; and that boundary the party imprisoned must be prevented from passing; he must be prevented from leaving that place, within the ambit of which the party imprisoning would confine him, except by prison-breach. Some confusion seems to me to arise from confounding imprisonment of the body with mere loss of freedom: it is one part of the definition of freedom to be able to go withersoever one pleases; but imprisonment is something more than the mere loss of this power; it includes the notion of restraint within some limits defined by a will or power exterior to our own.935."

When a minor is kept against the will of the person, who has the custody of such a child and/or who is entitled to take the custody of the child, such detention would amount to 'wrongful confinement'. In such a case, it is the will of the person, who is entitled to have custody of such a child, which will be the will of the child, for, the child's willingness or 'consent' would be immaterial unless the welfare of the child, in a given case, demands removal of the child from the custody of the person, who is, otherwise, entitled to keep the custody of the child. Guardian and custodian are not synonymous with each other. Thus, even when a parent, who, with impunity, snatches away a child from the lawful custody of the other parent, who held such custody and who is entitled to have the custody of the child under the law—personal, statutory or otherwise—such snatching away of the child and his detention against the will of the parent in whose custody the child was, would amount to an offence of 'wrongful confinement'.944.\n\n\n\n\n\n928.

A wrongful confinement is a wrongful restraint in such a manner as to prevent that person from proceeding beyond a certain circumscribed limits. This offence has nothing to do with the investigation or search.949. The essential ingredients of the offence \"wrongful confinement\" are that the accused should have wrongfully confined the complainant and such restraint was to prevent the complainant from proceeding beyond certain circumscribed limits beyond which he/she has a right to proceed. The factual scenario clearly establishes commission by the appellant as well of the offence punishable under section 342 IPC, 1860.950. Confinement need not necessarily be a confinement where the person is physically held within a certain circumscribed limit. To support the charge of wrongful confinement, proof of actual physical obstruction is not essential. It is the condition of the mind of the person confined, having regard to the circumstances that leads him to reasonably believe that he was not free to move and that he would be forthwith restrained if he attempted to do so.951.\nWhere a man, illegally taken into police custody was beaten by the police and he committed suicide, the accused police officials were punished under section 342. Case under sections 352 and 302 was not made out.952. Wife suffered a blow of hammer on left side below ear and immediately died on spot. Accused husband convicted under section 342 and 302 IPC, 1860.953. Victim after being arrested was kept in police station for three days and was not produced before a Magistrate within 24 hours. SHO cannot be absolved from the charges under section 342.954. In Vadamalai v Syed Thastha Keer,955. the complainant was allegedly detained and beaten by appellant/police officials in Police Station but the evidence does not show that he was kept in police station for four days. Conviction of the appellant by High Court under sections 323, 342 held not sustainable and liable to be set aside.\nThe officers who visited the house of the accused for making inquiry under Money Lenders Act, were not allowed to go out of the house for some time. It was found that there was no apprehension in their mind about use of force in case they tried to move out. It was held that no offence under section 342 was made out.956.\n\n\n\n\n\n949.

Here, if A intends to cause injury, fear or annoyance to Z, he uses criminal force to Z.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThe preceding section defines 'force'. This section says that 'force' becomes criminal\n(1) when it is used without consent and in order to the committing of an offence, or (2) when it is intentionally used to cause injury, fear or annoyance to another to whom the force is used. To attract the definition of 'criminal force' under section 350 IPC, 1860, there must be intentional use of force on any person, without that person's consent. Such force must have been used for committing an offence, or intending to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause injury, fear or annoyance to the person on whom the force is used. In other words, the criminal force contemplated under this section is intended to mean criminal force as applied to a person and not as applied to an inanimate object or substance.962. A person is said to use force when he causes motion or change of motion or cessation of motion to another person or the above in substance, which brings it into contact with any part of the other person's body or with anything that the other is wearing or carrying, or with anything so situated that such contact affects other's sense of feeling. This should be done by his own bodily power or by use of some substance or by inducing any animal to change this motion. The use of force will become criminal when it is done against the consent of any person with the intention of committing an offence or to cause injury, fear or annoyance to any person. In this case admittedly no assault was resorted to.963.\nThe term 'criminal force' includes what in English law is called 'battery'. It will, however, be remembered that 'criminal force' may be so slight as not to amount to an offence (section 95), and it will be observed that 'criminal force' does not include anything that the doer does by means of another person. The definition of 'criminal force' is so wide as to include force of almost every description of which a person is the ultimate object."

As seen from the definition of \"assault\", a gesture or even a preparation on the part of accused would be sufficient to constitute \"assault\" and accused need not have even attacked the deceased.\nThe apprehension of the use of criminal force must be from the person making the gesture or preparation, and if that apprehension arises not from that person but from somebody else, it does not amount to assault on the part of that person. Further, criminal force cannot be said to be used by one person to another by causing change in the position of another human being. Where, therefore, the accused himself did nothing which could come under the definition of assault but simply made a gesture at which his followers advanced a little forward towards the complainant in a threatening manner, it was held that he was not guilty of the offence of assault under section 353.968. Where the accused, armed with a sharp-edged weapon, went to the shop of a man and hurled a challenge to him from some distance asking him to come out and threatening him that he would not go back without killing him, it was held that the manner in which the accused hurled the challenge, he committed an assault within the meaning of section 351 and the retaliation by that man was in self-defence.969.\nThough mere preparation to commit a crime is not punishable (see section 511), yet preparation with the intention specified in this section amounts to an assault: see ill. (b).\n2. 'Intending or knowing it to be likely'.—Intention or knowledge is the gist of the offence. Inadvertent recklessness, i.e., a failure to give thought to the possibility of risk involved in pursuing a course of action, is insufficient to amount to mens rea requisite for a conviction for assault.970."

A preparation taken with words which would cause a person to apprehend that criminal force would be used to him, if he persisted in a particular course of conduct, does not amount to an assault, if there is no evidence to show that the accused was about to use criminal force to him then and there.972."

The accused contended that the offences had been committed whilst he was under the influence of alcohol and in response to his inability to cope with the breakdown of the relationship.\nIt was held that repeated threats by the accused to kill justified the sentence imposed, notwithstanding the presence of several mitigating factors including his attempts to seek help for his alcohol addiction and depression.

The sentence was imposed as it was deemed necessary in order to protect the public from a man who the court held and shown himself to be capable of extreme violence against previous partners and who, the medical experts and probation service agreed, was likely to re-offend.\nIt was held that given his early guilty plea and the fact that he could not realistically have carried out the threats as he had been in prison at the time, the sentence was reduced to five years to bring it in the sentencing in comparable cases.\n975.

Similarly, where a forest officer who was authorised to arrest a person only when the offence was committed within five miles of the border arrested the accused when there was no evidence that the offence was committed within the five mile belt, it was held that the arrest not being justified, the accused did not commit any offence under this section by inflicting some injuries on the officer during a scuffle.987. Legality of the execution of duty is the sine qua non for the application of section 353 IPC, 1860.988. Where a Headmaster of a school was assaulted with a ruler by a fellow teacher out of previous personal grudge and not due to any performance of public duty, it was held that the accused could not be convicted under section 353 though his conviction under section 325, IPC, 1860 was legal as the Headmaster suffered a dislocation of the right shoulder joint.989.

It was observed that to feel annoyed at this action of the accused would be the natural reaction of the Assistant Superintendent.990. Where the driver of the Transport Department prevented a Deputy Sarpanch from entering the bus through driver's cabin and was kicked by the latter and thus suffered a grievous injury, it was held while driving or standing by the bus the driver was on public duty and by stopping a trespass into driver's cabin he was undoubtedly acting in the discharge of his duty as public servant. The Deputy Sarpanch was, therefore, clearly liable under section 353, IPC, 1860.991.\n\nPetitioner used vulgar and fitting language against complainant when he went to petitioner's office to ask reason for not permitting him to mark his presence in Attendance Register.

The accused suspected that the complainant public servant was instrumental in his transfer. The complainant was proceeding to his office to resume his duty. On the way he was assaulted by the accused. It was held that no offence was committed under section 353 because the public servant was not assaulted to deter him from discharge of his duty.995. The wife of the accused was being taken to Police Station in execution of search warrant accompanied by a police constable. The accused attacked his wife and also the police constable. Conviction of the accused under section 353 was held to be proper, though no injury as such was caused to the constable. The Court observed that actual causing of injury is not necessary for conviction under section 353.996. In a complaint under sections 323 and 329 the investigating Head Constable demanded bribe for arresting some persons and was caught red-handed in a trap but on his call the villagers attacked the raiding party and snatched away their belongings and currency notes used in the trap, thus deterring the public servants from discharging their duties and rescuing the accused from the lawful custody of the Inspector of the raiding party. Conviction of the Head Constable under section 395 read with section 109, sections 353/109 and 224, the constable whom the head constable handed over the money under section 395 and the villagers under sections 353, 149, 226 and 147 was upheld.997.

Where an accused voluntarily obstructs a public servant in the discharge of his duties, section 186 IPC, 1860 is attracted. But under section 353, there must be in addition to the obstruction use of criminal force or assault to the public servant while he was discharging his duty. It may also be noted that the quality of the two offences is also different. While section 186 occurs in Chapter X dealing with contempt of the lawful authority of public servants, section 353 appears in Chapter XVI which deals with offences affecting the human body. This is also a clear indication that use of criminal force contemplated under section 353 IPC, 1860 is against a person and not against any inanimate object.999.\n\n\n\n\n\n977.

Therefore, if any person uses criminal force upon any woman with the intention or knowledge that the woman's modesty will be outraged, he is to be punished. In Vishaka v State of Rajasthan,1001. and Apparel Export Promotion Council v AK Chopra,1002. the Supreme Court held that the offence relating to modesty of woman cannot be treated as trivial. In order to constitute the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 mere knowledge that the modesty of a woman is likely to be outraged is sufficient without any deliberate intention of such outrage alone for its object. There is no abstract conception of modesty that can apply to all cases. A careful approach has to be adopted by the Court while dealing with a case alleging outrage of modesty.\nThe essential ingredients of the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 are as under:\n\n(1) That the person assaulted must be a woman.\n(2) Accused must have used criminal force on her intending thereby to outrage her modesty.\n(3) What constitutes an outrage to female modesty is nowhere defined—The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex.\n(4) Act of pulling a woman, removing her dress coupled with a request for sexual intercourse, as such would be an outrage to the modesty of a woman.\n(5) Knowledge, that modesty is likely to be outraged, is sufficient to constitute the offence without any deliberate intention of having such outrage alone for its object.1003.\nIntention is not the sole criterion of the offence punishable under section 354, IPC, 1860 and it can be committed by a person assaulting or using criminal force to any woman, if he knows that by such act the modesty of the woman is likely to be affected. Knowledge and intention are essentially things of the mind and cannot be demonstrated like physical objects. The existence of intention or knowledge has to be culled out from various circumstances in which and upon whom the alleged offence is alleged to have been committed.1004. Even though it is true that assault or criminal force to woman is one of the essential pre-conditions for applicability of section 354 IPC, 1860 but the same has to be with an intent to outrage her modesty or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty. Neither the use of criminal force alone nor act of outraging the modesty alone is sufficient to attract an offence under section 354 IPC, 1860.1005."

      "title": "Modesty.—Meaning.—",
      "content": "The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. The culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive. Modesty is an attribute associated with female human beings as a\n\nclass. It is virtue which attaches to a family owing to her sex. The ultimate test for ascertaining whether the modesty of a woman has been outraged, assaulted or insulted is that the action of the offender should be such that it may be perceived as one which is capable of shocking the sense of decency of a woman. A person slapping on the posterior of a woman in full public glare would amount to outraging her modesty for it was not only an affront to the normal sense of feminine decency but also an affront to the dignity of the lady. The word \"modesty\" is not to be interpreted with reference to the particular victim of the act, but as an attribute associated with female human beings as a class. It is a virtue which attaches to a female on account of her sex.1006. In State of Punjab v Major Singh,1007., a three-Judge Bench of the Supreme Court considered the question — Whether modesty of a female child of seven and half months can also be outraged. The majority view was in the affirmative. Bachawat, J, on behalf of majority, opined as:\nThe offence punishable u/s. 354 is an assault on or use of criminal force to a woman with the intention of outraging her modesty or with the knowledge of the likelihood of doing so. The Code does not define 'modesty'. What then is a woman's modesty? … The essence of a woman's modesty is her sex. The modesty of an adult female is written large on her body. Young or old, intelligent or imbecile, awake or sleeping, the woman possesses a modesty capable of being outraged. Whoever uses criminal force to her with intent to outrage her modesty commits an offence punishable u/s. 354. The culpable intention of the accused is the crux of the matter. The reaction of the woman is very relevant, but its absence is not always decisive, as, for example, when the accused with a corrupt mind stealthily touches the flesh of a sleeping woman. She may be an idiot, she may be under the spell of anaesthesia, she may be sleeping, she may be unable to appreciate the significance of the act; nevertheless, the offender is punishable under the section.1008.\n\nAn indecent assault upon a woman is punished under this section. Rape is punished under section 376; but the offence under this section is of less gravity than rape.1009. Knowledge that modesty is likely to be outraged has been held to be sufficient to constitute the offence without any deliberate intention to outrage modesty. In this case the victim woman was brought into a room under false pretexts, the room was locked from outside, inside she was forced to drink, photographs taken in naked state and raped. All the participants were held to be guilty of outraging her modesty.1010. A person who is guilty of attempting rape cannot be allowed to escape with the lesser penalty of this section. Where the accused walked into the room where a female child of seven and a half months was sleeping and committed an indecent assault on the child, he was held to have committed an offence under this section as he had outraged and intended to outrage whatever modesty the little victim was capable of.1011. Their Lordships of the House of Lords have pointed out that a person is guilty of indecent assault if he intentionally assaults the victim and intends to commit not just an assault but an indecent assault, i.e., an assault which right-minded persons would think is indecent. Accordingly, any evidence explaining the defendant's conduct, whether an admission by him or otherwise, is admissible to establish whether he intended to commit an indecent assault. In this case,1012. a 26-year-old shop assistant pulled a 12- year-old girl visitor to the shop across his knees and smacked her with his hand 12 times on her bottom outside her shorts for no apparent reason. On being asked he explained his weakness as \"buttock fetish\". But for this admission there was nothing to convert the assault (to which he confessed) into an indecent one. His explanation to his secret motive was held to be relevant to hold him guilty of indecent assault. Moreover, according to section 10, IPC, 1860 a woman denotes a female human being of any age. Where the woman is a consenting party there cannot be any outraging of modesty.1013. Unless culpable intention is proved mere touching the belly of a female in a public bus cannot be called a deliberate act of outraging the modesty of a female within the meaning of this section. In the circumstances of the case the act of the accused was held to be accidental and not intentional.1014. Where the accused caught hold of a married woman and tried to open the string of her salwar with a view to committing rape on her but being hit by the woman with a kulhari fled away, it was held that he could not be convicted under section 376 read with section 511 IPC, 1860 as\n\nhis action did not show a determination to have sexual intercourse at all events and in spite of resistance. The conviction of the accused was accordingly changed to one under section 354, IPC, 1860.1015.\nWhere the allegation was, while the victim was returning from home, the accused came from behind and pressed her breast, the Court convicted him under section 354 IPC, 1860.1016. The accused came from behind her and caught hold of her and laid her down on the cot and sat on her chest. She shouted and after that the accused left her house. After hearing her shouts, her cousin mother-in-law came there. High Court rejected the defence of false implication and convicted the accused under section 354, IPC, 1860.1017. Where a married woman alleged that the two accused persons had dragged her in her own home and raped her one after the other and the medical evidence showed that though there were traces of semen on her clothes, there were none on the clothes of the accused persons, the Court opined that the case was not made out; the presence of semen on the clothes of a married woman is not unusual and therefore, the accused could have been prosecuted only for outraging the modesty of a woman.1018.\nSome labourers, including a woman, were taken to a police station for some work. When they demanded wages, they were beaten up. The woman was stripped bare and thrashed. The matter came before the Supreme Court in a writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution. The Supreme Court held that the offence under section 354, IPC, 1860 was established in reference to the woman and awarded compensation to be recovered from the salary of the guilty officers.1019. The offence was held to have been made out where a senior police officer slapped the posterior of the prosecutrix in the midst of guests in a party. The accused must have been fully aware that such an act would embarrass her and outrage her modesty. She made hue and cry immediately. Her conduct did not suggest that she was stage-managing things to malign the accused. The Court observed such behaviour was not expected from a high-ranked police officer. His conviction for the offence under the section was maintained by the Supreme Court.1020."

      "content": "Dividing line between attempt to commit rape and indecent assault is not only thin but also is practically invisible. Evidence of informant that when she went to the house of accused, she found that the victim was sleeping on the floor and accused was lying on her. Accused removed her nicker with a view to commit sexual intercourse. Medical evidence does not indicate as to whether accused has tried to force his penis inside the private part of girl but could not succeed. Offence committed by accused did not amount to attempt to commit rape punishable under section 376 read with section 511 of IPC, 1860 but was one under section 354.1022. Though there was ample evidence that the victim was disrobed by the accused and thus the accused, outraged her modesty there was no evidence of rape. Conviction under section 376 was altered to section 354.1023. But in State of UP v Rajit Ram1024. the Supreme Court set aside a judgment by which a conviction under section 376 was altered to section 354 and\n\nremitted the case back to trial court. The accused in another case had forcibly laid the prosecutrix on the bed and broken her pyjama's string but made no attempt to undress himself and when the prosecutrix pushed him away, he did not make efforts to grab her again. It was held that it was not an attempt to rape but only outraging of the modesty of a woman and conviction under section 354 was proper.1025. But in Ram Mehar v State of Haryana,1026. the accused caught hold of the prosecutrix, lifted her and then took her to a bajra field where, he pinned her down and tried to open her salwar but could not do so as the prosecutrix had injured him by giving a sickle blow. The accused failed to give his blood sample with the result it could be presumed that his innocence was doubtful. Ocular evidence of the prosecutrix was also corroborated by other evidence. It was held that conviction of the accused under sections 354, 376/511 was proper. The accused caught the victim from behind, pushed her on ground, removed her panty and attempted rape. Upon getting opportunity she kicked him in testicles and escaped from place of occurrence. The accused was convicted under section 511 read with section 376.1027."

Where the prosecutrix did not state specifically about the act, but has loosely described as \"fondling\", the Supreme Court altered the conviction from section 376 to section 354.1029. Victim, a deaf and dumb girl aged 13 years was lured by the accused from her house to a distant place. When family of victim reached place, the accused fled away leaving victim who was weeping. Her clothes were soiled with mud and accused concealed it. Accused was liable to be convicted under section 354.1030. Where the accused touched the hand of the blind prosecutrix, removed the quilt with which she was covering herself and put his hand in her 'midi', conviction of the accused for attempt to commit rape was set aside but conviction under sections 354, 457 and 506 was confirmed.1031.\n\nWhere the accused forcibly laid the prosecutrix on bed and cut the string of her pyjama and tore her underwear but did not undress himself, the offence fell under section 354 and the offence of attempt to commit rape was not made out.1032.\nWhere the accused persons caught hold of a woman and removed the 'saree' from her person but ran away on seeing someone approaching, their act attracted section 354 and not sections 375/511.

The Committee was of the view that it is not sufficient for the State to legislate and establish machinery of prosecution, but conscious and well-thought-out attempts are required to be made to ensure the culture of mutual respect is fostered in India's children. Preventive measures for the initial minor aberrations were deemed necessary to check their escalation into major sexual aberrations.\nThe definition of this offence has the following ingredients:\n\n(I) If a person—\n\n(i) either watches,\n(ii) or captures the image.\n\n\n\n\n\n1043.

    "section361.3": {
      "title": "'Takes or entices any minor'.—",
      "content": "The Supreme Court considered the interpretation of expression 'takes or entices' in S Varadarajan v State of Madras,1058. and State of Haryana v Rajaram.1059. The purpose and object of section 361 IPC, 1860 appears to be in dispute. In Varadarajan, the Supreme Court had occasion to consider this. In section 498 IPC, 1860 we find identical expression 'takes or entices' employed by the legislature. That was of course for a totally different offence. While considering the object of section 361 IPC, 1860, the Supreme Court in Varadarajan, took the view that the interpretation of the expression 'takes or entices' in section 498 IPC, 1860 cannot be blindly and mechanically imported while considering the interpretation of the same expression in section 361 IPC, 1860. It took the view that section 498 IPC, 1860 is meant essentially for protection of the rights of the husband, whereas section 361 IPC, 1860 and other cognate sections of the IPC, 1860 are intended more for the protection of minors and persons of unsound mind than the rights of the guardians of such persons. But in Rajaram, the Supreme Court held that:\nThe object of this section seems as much to protect the minor children from being seduced for improper purposes as to protect the rights and privileges of guardians having the lawful charge or custody of their minor wards. The gravamen of this offence lies in the taking or enticing of a minor under the ages specified in this section, out of the keeping of the lawful guardian without the consent of such guardian. The words 'takes or entices any minor … out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor' in S. 361, are significant. The use of the word 'keeping' in the context connotes the idea of charge, protection, maintenance and control: further the guardian's charge and control appears to be compatible with the independence of action and movement in the minor, the guardian's protection and control of the minor being available, whenever necessity arises. On plain reading of this section the consent of the minor who is taken or enticed is wholly immaterial: it is only the guardian's consent which takes the case out of its purview. Nor is it necessary that the taking or enticing must be shown to have been by means of force or fraud. Persuasion by the accused person which creates willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian would be sufficient to attract the section.\n\nA person who allows such a minor who is already out of the keeping of the guardian to accompany him commits no offence under section 361 IPC, 1860. That alone is the dictum in Varadarajan. It is no authority on the question whether consent of a minor (even a knowledgeable minor close to 18 years) is relevant or crucial in a prosecution under section 361 IPC, 1860. Later a two-Judge Bench in T D Vadgama v State of Gujarat,1060. ascertained the precise distinction in the dictum between the three-Judge Benches in Varadarajan and Rajaram. The dictum in Varadarajan turned on its own peculiar facts. It was held:\nit would, however, be sufficient if the prosecution establishes that though immediately prior to the minor leaving the father's protection no active part was played by the accused, he had at some earlier stage solicited or persuaded the minor to do so. In our opinion, if evidence to establish one of those things is lacking, it would not be legitimate to infer that the accused is guilty of taking the minor out of the keeping of the lawful guardian merely because after she has actually left her guardian's house or a house where her guardian had kept her, joined the accused and the accused helped her in her design not to return to her guardian's house by taking her along with him from place to place. No doubt, the part played by the accused could be regarded as facilitating the fulfilment of the intention of the girl. That part, in our\n\nopinion, falls short of an inducement to the minor to slip out of the keeping of her lawful guardian and is, therefore, not tantamount to 'taking'.\n\nThe intention with which kidnapping is effected can be ascertained from the circumstances of the offence at the time of occurrence or prior or subsequent to it. A kidnapping does not per se lead to any inference of intent or purpose of kidnapping.1061. Persuasion by the accused which created willingness on the part of the minor to be taken out of the keeping of the lawful guardian was held by the Supreme Court to be enough to attract section 361. The Supreme Court also restated the ingredients.1062.\nPromise of marriage made to the minor girl for leaving the house of the lawful guardian was held to be an enticement.1063.\nThe word 'take' means 'to cause to go' to escort or to get into possession. It implies want of wish and absence of desire of the person taken. There is a distinction between taking and allowing a minor to accompany a person.1064."

The statement of objects and reasons are as follows:\nStatement of Objects and Reasons. - Kidnappings by terrorists for ransom, for creating panic amongst the people and for securing release of arrested associates and cadres have assumed serious dimensions. The existing provisions of law have proved to be inadequate as deterrence. The Law Commission in its 42nd Report has also recommended a specific provision to deal with this menace. It [was] necessary to amend the Indian Penal Code to provide for deterrent punishment to persons committing such acts and to make consequential amendments to the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.\n\nIt is clear from the above the concern of Parliament in dealing with cases relating to kidnapping for ransom, a crime which called for a deterrent punishment, irrespective of the fact that kidnapping had not resulted in death of the victim. Considering the alarming rise in kidnapping young children for ransom, the legislature in its wisdom provided for stringent sentence.1097."

'Sells, lets to hire, or otherwise disposes of'.—These words are the counterpart of the words \"buys, hires or otherwise obtains possession\", occurring in section 373. The performance of gejee (initiation ceremony) on a minor girl does not amount to her disposal.1163. The ceremony of tying a talimani to a minor girl, worshipping a basin of water by her and distributing food is merely a preliminary step before the selling, letting out, or disposing of the girl for the purpose of prostitution, and is no offence under this section.1164.\n2. 'Person under the age of eighteen years'.—The section applies to all persons under 18 years, whether males or females.\n3. 'With intent that such persons shall at any age be employed or used for the purpose of prostitution or illicit intercourse with any person or for any unlawful and immoral purpose'.—It is necessary to show that the accused intended that the person shall be employed for an immoral purpose. The introduction of the words 'at any age' takes away the defence that though a girl was made over to a prostitute it was not intended that she should actually be used for the purpose of prostitution until she had passed the age of eighteen years.1165.\nThe word 'prostitution' is not confined to acts of natural sexual intercourse, but includes any act of lewdness. It means surrender of a girl's chastity for money.\nThe words 'illicit intercourse with any person' are explained in Explanation 2. The accused cannot now rely on the plea that the girl was not destined for a life of prostitution, but merely for a single act of sexual intercourse. Cases which laid down that no offence was committed if employment for prostitution was not habitual are no longer of any authority."

Secondly.— Without her consent. Thirdly.—With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested in fear of death or of hurt. Fourthly.—With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband, and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another man to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.

The definition of rape has undergone a major change in admitting non- penile penetration also but it continues to be gender-specific as committed against a female. Earlier, a public interest litigation in Sakshi v UOI,1174. seeking for a declaration to treat non-penile penetration also to be treated as rape failed when the Supreme Court declined the relief but the Court's exhortation to alter the definition paved way for the change of law."

      "content": "Based on the recommendations made by the Justice Verma Committee, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, came into force with effect from 3 February 2013. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 made amendments to the Cr PC, 1973, Indian Evidence Act, 1872 and the IPC, 1860. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 expanded the definition of rape and substituted new sections for old sections such as sections 370, 375, 376, 376A, 376B, 376C and 376D. The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 also amended existing sections as well as created new offences in the IPC, 1860, such as:\n\n• Public servant disobeying direction under law (section 166A)\n• Punishment for non-treatment of victim (section 166B)\n• Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid, etc. (section 326A)\n• Voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid (section 326B)\n• Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment (section 354A)\n• Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe (section 354B)\n• Voyeurism (section 354C)\n• Stalking (section 354D)\n• Punishment for repeat offenders (section 376E)\n\nThe altered definition increasing the age of consent to 18 is also significant for it makes any form of penetration as set out under the section with any girl less than 18 years of age to constitute rape. In a matrimonial setting, it would not have resulted in rape if the woman was still less than 18 and above 15 so long as there was consent by virtue of Exception 2 contained in the section. But the decision of the Supreme Court in\n\nIndependent Thought v UOI,1175. has held the provision to be unconstitutional in so far it relates to girl between ages 15 to 18. Now the Exception 2 has to be read as 'Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under eighteen years of age is not rape'.\nRape is violative of victim's fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution. It is the most morally and physically reprehensible crime in a society, as it is an assault on the body, mind and privacy of the victim. While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless female. Rape reduces a woman to an animal, as it shakes the very core of her life. By no means can a rape victim be called an accomplice. Rape leaves a permanent scar on the life of the victim, and therefore a rape victim is placed on a higher pedestal than an injured witness. Rape is a crime against the entire society and violates the human rights of the victim. Being the most hated crime, rape tantamounts to a serious blow to the supreme honour of a woman, and offends both, her esteem and dignity. It causes psychological and physical harm to the victim, leaving upon her indelible marks.1176."

Consent is an act of reason, accompanied by deliberation, the mind weighing, as in a balance, the good and evil on each side. There is a clear distinction between rape and consensual sex and the Court must very carefully examine whether the accused had actually wanted to marry the victim, or had mala fide motive, and had made a false promise to this effect only to satisfy his lust, as the latter falls within the ambit of cheating or deception. There is a distinction between the mere breach of a promise, and not fulfilling a false promise. Thus, the Court must examine whether there was made, at an early stage a false promise of marriage by the accused; and whether the consent involved was given after wholly understanding the nature and consequences of sexual indulgence. There may be a case where the prosecutrix agrees to have sexual intercourse on account of her love and passion for the accused, and not solely on account of misrepresentation made to her by the accused, or where an accused on account of circumstances which he could not have foreseen, or which were beyond his control, was unable to marry her, despite having every intention to do so. Such cases must be treated differently. An accused can be convicted for rape only if the Court reaches a conclusion that the intention of the accused was mala fide, and that he had clandestine motives.1179. Where a man and woman were living together, sometimes at her house and sometimes at the residence of the man and when the evidence suggested that it was not a case of a passive submission in the face of any psychological pressure exerted and there was a tacit consent not borne out of any misconception created in her mind, complaint under this section will be untenable.1180. In the event that the accused's promise is not false and has not been made with the\n\nsole intention to seduce the prosecutrix to indulge in sexual acts, such an act(s) would not amount to rape. Thus, the same would only hold that the prosecutrix, under a misconception of fact to the extent that the accused is likely to marry her, submits to the lust of the accused, such a fraudulent act cannot be said to be consensual, so far as the offence of the accused is concerned.1181."

      "title": "Consent.—Meaning.—",
      "content": "IPC, 1860 does not define consent in positive terms. But what cannot be regarded as consent is explained by section 90 which reads as 'consent given first under fear of injury and second under a misconception of fact is not consent at all'. There are two grounds specified in section 90 which are analogous to coercion and mistake of fact. The factors set out in first part of section 90 are from the point of view of the victim and second part of section 90 enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It envisages that the accused has knowledge or has reason to believe that the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of fact. Thus, the second part lays emphasis on the knowledge or reasonable belief of the person who obtains the tainted consent. The requirements of both the parts should be cumulatively satisfied. In other words, the Court has to see whether the person giving the consent has given it under fear or misconception of fact and the Court should also be satisfied that the person doing the act, i.e., the alleged offender is conscious of the fact or should have reason to think that but for the fear or misconception, the consent would not have been given. This is the scheme of section 90 which is couched in negative terminology. As observed in Deelip Singh @ Dilip Kumar v State of Bihar,1182. section 90 cannot be considered as an exhaustive definition of consent for the purposes of IPC, 1860. The normal connotation and concept of consent is not intended to be excluded.1183. Submission of the body under the fear or terror cannot be construed as a consented sexual act. Consent for the purpose of section 375 requires voluntary participation not only after the exercise of intelligence based on the knowledge of the significance and moral quality of the act but after having fully exercised the choice between resistance and assent. Whether there was consent or not, is to be ascertained only on a careful study of all relevant circumstances.1184. The consent does not merely mean hesitation or reluctance or a 'No' to any sexual advances but has to be an affirmative one in clear terms. Consent has to be categorical, unequivocal, voluntary and could be given by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication signifying willingness to participate in specific sexual act. Woman who does not physically resist act of rape shall not by that reason only be regarded as having consented to such sexual activity. In normal parlance, consent would mean voluntary agreement of complainant to engage in sexual activity without being abused or exploited by coercion or threats. Normal rule is that consent has to be given and it cannot be assumed.1185."

      "content": "In Dileep Singh v State of Bihar,1186. the Supreme Court observed that:\n\nthough will and consent often interlace and an act done against the will of the person can be said to be an act done without consent, the Indian Penal Code categorizes these two expressions under separate heads in order to be as comprehensive as possible.\n\nIn the facts of the case what is crucial to be considered is whether first clause or second clause of section 375 IPC, 1860 is attracted. The expressions 'against her will' and 'without her consent' may overlap sometimes but surely the two expressions in first and second clause have different connotation and dimension. The expression 'against her will' would ordinarily mean that the intercourse was done by a man with a woman despite her resistance and opposition. On the other hand, the expression 'without her consent' would comprehend an act of reason accompanied by deliberation.1187.\nSupreme Court Guidelines to Prevent Child Sexual Abuse\n\n(1) The persons in charge of the schools/educational institutions, special homes, children homes, shelter homes, hostels, remand homes, jails, etc., or wherever children are housed, if they come across instances of sexual abuse or assault on a minor child which they believe to have committed or come to know that they are being sexually molested or assaulted are directed to report those facts keeping upmost secrecy to the nearest SJPU or local police, and they, depending upon the gravity of the complaint and its genuineness, take appropriate follow up action casting no stigma to the child or to the family members.\n(2) Media personals, persons in charge of Hotel, lodge, hospital, clubs, studios, photograph facilities have to duly comply with the provision of section 20 of the Act 32 of 2012 and provide information to the SJPU, or local police. Media has to strictly comply with section 23 of the Act as well.\n(3) Children with intellectual disability are more vulnerable to physical, sexual and emotional abuse. Institutions which house them or persons in care and protection, come across any act of sexual abuse, have a duty to bring to the notice of the Juvenile Justice Board/SJPU or local police and they in turn be in touch with the competent authority and take appropriate action.\n(4) Further, it is made clear that if the perpetrator of the crime is a family member himself, then utmost care be taken and further action be taken in consultation with the mother or other female members of the family of the child, bearing in mind the fact that best interest of the child is of paramount consideration.\n(5) Hospitals, whether Government or privately-owned or medical institutions where children are being treated come to know that children admitted are subjected to sexual abuse, the same will immediately be reported to the nearest JJ Board/SJPU and the JJ Board, in consultation with SJPU, should take appropriate steps in accordance with the law safeguarding the interest of child.\n(6) The non-reporting of the crime by anybody, after having come to know that a minor child below the age of 18 years was subjected to any sexual assault, is a serious crime and by not reporting they are screening offenders from legal punishment and hence be held liable under the ordinary criminal law and prompt action be taken against them, in accordance with law.\n\n(7) Complaints, if any, received by NCPCR, SCPCR, Child Welfare Committee (CWC) and Child Helpline, NGO's or Women's Organizations, etc., they may take further follow up action in consultation with the nearest JJ Board, SJPU or local police in accordance with law.\n(8) The Central Government and the State Governments are directed to constitute SJPUs in all the Districts, if not already constituted and they have to take prompt and effective action in consultation with JJ Board to take care of child and protect the child and also take appropriate steps against the perpetrator of the crime.\n(9) The Central Government and every State Government should take all measures as provided under section 43 of the The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (Act 32/2012) to give wide publicity of the provisions of the Act through media including television, radio and print media, at regular intervals, to make the general public, children as well as their parents and guardians, aware of the provisions of the Act.\n[Shankar Kisanrao Khade v State of Maharashtra.1188.]"

The amended section 376 IPC, 1860 prescribed a minimum punishment of seven years' imprisonment for the offence of rape. For combating the vice of custodial rape, rape on pregnant woman, rape on girls under 12 years of age and gang rape a minimum punishment of 10 years' imprisonment had been made obligatory. However, for special reasons to be recorded in the judgment the Court in either case could impose a sentence lesser than seven or 10 years, as the case may be.\nA further improvement in the law relating to sexual offences could be found in the provisions of section 228A IPC, 1860, section 327(2) Cr PC, 1973 and section 114A Indian Evidence Act, 1872 which were introduced by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983. New provisions for trial in camera (section 327(2) Cr PC, 1973) and against disclosure as to identity of the victims of sexual offences as in sections 376, 376A, 376B, 376C and 376D, IPC, 1860 (section 228, IPC, 1860) were not only to protect the honour of sexually-victimised women but also made it possible for them to depose in Court without any fear of social ostracism. And section 114A Indian Evidence Act, 1872 by raising a presumption as to absence of consent in cases of custodial rape, rape on pregnant women and gang rape as in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (g) of sub-section\n(2) of section 376, IPC, 1860 merely on the evidence of the ravished women had, at least partially, removed the infirmity from the evidence of a victim of rape that was hitherto unjustly attached to her testimony without taking note of the fact that in India, a disclosure of this nature was likely to ruin the prospect of the girl's rehabilitation in society for all times to come and unless her story was painfully true she would not have taken such a grave risk merely to malign the accused.1209. Moreover, in cases of rape, particularly custodial rape it was almost impossible to get any other independent evidence to corroborate the testimony of the prosecutrix.\nIt has been held that the result of the Amendment of 1983 is that the offences listed in section 376(2) are graver in nature and therefore, it is necessary that the charge under the sub-section should be distinctly recorded and also reasons for conviction should be recorded.1210."

Rape on a woman under 12 years of age is now made punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than 20 years, but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with fine or with death. Gang rape on a woman under 12 years of age is now made punishable with imprisonment for life, and with fine, or with death. Rape of girls below the age of 16 years is punishable with imprisonment of 20 years or life imprisonment. The imprisonment for life shall mean imprisonment for the remainder of that person's natural life. The minimum punishment for rape of girl above the age of 16 is 10 years.\nSection 376 is not gender neutral and sexual abuse of minor boys does not come within its purview. The punishment under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act, 2012 continues to be 10 years to life imprisonment for offences against boys below 12 and seven years to life imprisonment for offences against boys above 12 to 18.\nThe law amends the Cr PC, 1973 mandating the completing of investigation from the existing provision of three months to two months.

      "content": "In cases of rape or attempted rape medical examination of the victim and the accused soon after the incident often yields a wealth of corroborative evidence. Such an opportunity should not, therefore, be lost on any account. Though the prosecutrix can be examined only with her consent, the accused can be subjected to such an examination by virtue of section 53 of the Cr PC, 1973. It has also to be remembered that the accused too can demand such an examination under section 54 Cr PC, 1860 especially when he feels that such an examination will disprove the charge brought against him. Thus, presence of smegma on corona glandis (glans penis) of the accused soon after the incident is proof against complete penetration since it is rubbed off during intercourse.1211. But to be of any value examination of smegma must be done within 24 hours.1212.\n\nWhere proof of sexual intercourse with the woman is itself not an issue, such as when it is an admitted fact and the case rests upon issues of consent and where medical examination revealed semen stains on the vaginal swabs and salwar of the victim, the Court said that at best it is an evidence of commission of sexual intercourse but not necessarily of rape.1213."

In view of International Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, 1966; United Nations Declaration of Basic Principles of Justice for Victims of Crime and Abuse of Power, 1985, rape survivors are entitled to legal recourse that does not re-traumatise them or violate their physical or mental integrity and dignity. They are also entitled to medical procedures conducted in a manner that respects their right to consent. Medical procedures should not be carried out in a manner that constitutes cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment and health should be of paramount consideration while dealing with gender-based violence. The State is under an obligation to make such services available to survivors of sexual violence. Proper measures should be taken to ensure their safety and there should be no arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy.1214."

There is no rule of law that her testimony cannot be acted upon without corroboration in material particulars, for the reason, that she stands on a much higher pedestal than an injured witness.1215. A woman, who is the victim of sexual assault, is not an accomplice to the crime but is a victim of another person's lust and, therefore, her evidence need not be tested with the same amount of suspicion as that of an accomplice. The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 nowhere says that her evidence cannot be accepted unless it is corroborated in material particulars. She is undoubtedly a competent witness under section 118 and her evidence must receive the same weight as is attached to an injured in cases of physical violence.1216."

      "title": "Defence that the girl was of easy virtue.—",
      "content": "Whether the victim of rape was previously accustomed to sexual intercourse or not, cannot be the determinative question. On the contrary, the question still remains as to whether the accused committed rape on the victim on the occasion complained of. Even if the victim had lost her virginity earlier, it can certainly not give a licence to any person to rape her. It is the accused who was on trial and not the victim. So as to whether the victim is of a promiscuous character is totally irrelevant in a case of rape. Even a woman of easy virtue has a right to refuse to submit herself to sexual intercourse to anyone and everyone, because she is not a vulnerable object or prey for being sexually assaulted by anyone and everyone. A prosecutrix stands on a higher pedestal than an injured witness for the reason that an injured witness gets the injury on the physical form, while the prosecutrix suffers psychologically and emotionally.1217. In Narender Kumar v State (NCT of Delhi),1218. the Supreme Court dealt with a case where the allegation was that the victim of rape herself was an unchaste woman, and a woman of easy virtue. The Court discussed Rajoo v State of MP,1219. and held that so far as the prosecutrix is concerned, mere statement of prosecutrix herself is enough to record a conviction, when her evidence is read in its totality and found to be worthy of reliance. The incident in itself causes a great distress and humiliation to the victim though, undoubtedly a false allegation of rape can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused as well. The Court further held that some facts exist proving that victim was habituated to sexual intercourse, cannot be a reason to draw an inference that she was of 'loose moral character'. This cannot be a reason for her to be raped; she also has a right to protect her dignity and refuse to submit to sexual intercourse by anyone. Merely because a woman is of easy virtue, her evidence cannot be discarded on that ground alone rather it is to be cautiously appreciated.1220."

It was observed in Pratap Misra v State of Orissa,1223. where allegation was of rape by many persons and several times, but no injury was noticed. Presence of injury in this case, certainly is an important factor if the prosecutrix's version is credible, and then no corroboration would be necessary. But if the prosecutrix's version is not credible then there would be need for corroboration.1224."
    },
    "section376.13": {
      "title": "Corroboration of testimony.—",
      "content": "The trend of judicial opinion is that in rape cases corroboration is not a matter of law, but a guide of prudence, as the testimony of the victim is vital unless there are compelling reasons for corroboration.1225. The Supreme Court has held that a woman who has been raped is not an accomplice. If she was ravished she is the victim of an outrage and if she consented there is no rape. In the case of a girl below the age of consent, her consent will not matter so far as the offence of rape is concerned, but if she consented her evidence will be suspect as that of an accomplice. The true rule of\n\nprudence requires that in every case of this type the advisability of corroboration should be present in the mind of the Judge and that must be indicated in the judgment. But corroboration can be dispensed with by the Judge if in the particular circumstances of the case before him he himself is satisfied that it is safe to do so.1226. Indeed no rule of thumb can be laid down in this matter for every case must depend a good deal on its own peculiar facts and circumstances. Thus, in Rafiq's case1227. Krishna Iyer, J, observed:\nwhen no woman of honour will accuse another of rape since she sacrifices thereby what is dearest to her, he cannot cling to a fossil formula and insist on corroborative evidence, even if taken as a whole, the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as probable … When a woman is ravished what is inflicted is not merely physical injury but the deep sense of some deathless shame … Judicial response to human rights cannot be blunted by legal bigotry.\n\nSimilarly, in Bhoginbhai's case1228. Thakkar, J, observed with some anguish:\n\nIn the Indian setting refusal to act on the testimony of the victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as a rule is adding insult to injury … A girl or a woman in the tradition bound non-permissive society of India would be extremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which is likely to reflect on her chastity had ever occurred. She would be conscious of the danger of being ostracised by the society … And when in the face of these factors the crime is brought to light, there is built-in assurance that the charge is genuine rather than fabricated … Just as a witness who has sustained an injury (which is not shown or believed to be self-inflicted) is the best witness in the sense that he is least likely to exculpate the real offender, the evidence of a victim of sex offence is entitled to great weight absence of corroboration notwithstanding.\n\nRefusal by the accused person to subject himself to blood test for the purpose of determining his fatherhood of the child who was born as a result of the alleged rape was considered to be an evidence of corroboration.1229."

It was held that conviction of the accused under section 376 was rightly set aside.1235.\nThe prosecutrix was an educated woman and employed. She went in the jeep of the accused at night for a long distance intending to meet her senior officer. She alleged that she was raped by the accused in his house when they halted there.

The Supreme Court has held that the mere fact that the prosecutrix was of loose moral character and was used to sexual intercourse and might have gone to the accused herself, were not grounds to disbelieve her statement. Such facts could demolish the case of abduction. But the prosecutrix, being of 10–11 years of age, was not capable of giving consent for abusing her sexually.

He had made about 1000 telephone calls over\n\na two weeks' period to 15 complainants. The calls had been made for his sexual gratification and had involved him ordering his victims to perform sexual acts against themselves, under threat of rape or serious physical injury. He had a record of previous convictions for using the telephone system to send offensive and indecent matter.\nIt was held that the sentencing judge was entitled to conclude that the offences committed by the accused had been comparable to rape and indecent assault. His previous convictions, together with the pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report, also demonstrated that he presented a continuing and escalating danger to women. Accordingly, the sentence imposed was not excessive.1249."

It is important to have someone who is well-acquainted with the criminal justice system. The role of the victim's advocate would not only be to explain to the victim the nature of the proceedings, to prepare her for the case and to assist her in the police station and in Court but to provide her with guidance as to how she might obtain help of a different nature from other agencies, for example, mind counselling or medical assistance. It is important to secure continuity of assistance by ensuring that the same person who looked after the complainant's interests in the police station represents her till the end of the case.\n(2) Legal assistance will have to be provided at the police station since the victim of sexual assault might very well be in a distressed state upon arrival at the police station, the guidance and support of a lawyer at this stage and whilst she was being questioned would be of great assistance to her.\n(3) The police should be under a duty to inform the victim of her right to representation before any questions were asked of her and that the police report should state that the victim was so informed.\n(4) A list of advocates willing to act in these cases should be kept at the police station for victims who did not have a particular lawyer in mind or whose own lawyer was unavailable.\n(5) The advocate shall be appointed by the Court, upon application by the police at the earliest convenient moment, but in order to ensure that victims were questioned without undue delay, advocates would be authorised to act at the police station before leave of the Court was sought or obtained.\n(6) In all rape trials anonymity of the victim must be maintained, as far as necessary.\n(7) It is necessary, having regard to the Directive Principles contained under Article 38(1) of the Constitution of India to set up Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Rape victims frequently incur substantial financial loss. Some, for example, are too traumatised to continue in employment.\n(8) Compensation for victims shall be awarded by the Court on conviction of the offender and by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board whether or not a conviction has taken place. The Board will take into account pain, suffering and shock as well as loss of earnings due to pregnancy and the expenses of child birth if this occurred as a result of the rape.\n\nIn addition thereto, it is an obligation on the part of the State authorities and particularly, the Director General of Police and Home Ministry of the State to issue proper guidelines and instructions to the other authorities as how to deal with such cases and what kind of treatment is to be given to the prosecutrix, as a victim of sexual assault requires a totally different kind of treatment not only from the society but also\n\n\n\n\n\n1172.

The offence purported to consist in a carnal knowledge committed against the order of nature by a person with a man, or in the same unnatural manner with a woman, or by a man or woman in any manner with an animal. To attract the above offence, the following ingredients were required: 1) Carnal intercourse and 2) against the order of nature."

      "content": "The Delhi High Court in a landmark judgment declared section 377 IPC, 1860 unconstitutional, insofar it criminalised consensual sexual acts of adults in private as violative of Articles 21, 14 and 15 of the Constitution.1266. But in Suresh Kumar Koushal v NAZ Foundation,1267. the Supreme Court overruled the Delhi High Court judgment holding that those who indulge in carnal intercourse in the ordinary course and those who indulge in carnal intercourse against the order of nature constitute different classes and the people falling in the latter category cannot claim that section 377 suffers from the vice of arbitrariness and irrational classification. What section 377 does is merely to define the particular offence and prescribe punishment for the same which can be awarded if in the trial conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Cr PC, 1973 and other statutes of the same family the person is found guilty. Therefore, section 377 IPC, 1860 was held to be not ultra vires Articles 14 and 15 of the Constitution. It was also observed by the Supreme Court that the Court merely pronounced on the correctness of the view taken by the Delhi High Court on the constitutionality of section 377 IPC, 1860 and found that the said section did not suffer from any constitutional infirmity. Notwithstanding this verdict, the competent legislature shall be free to consider the desirability and propriety of deleting section 377 IPC, 1860 from the statute book or amend the same.\nA constitution bench of the Supreme Court in Navtej Singh Johar v UOI,1268. overruled Suresh Kumar Koushal and held that consensual carnal intercourse among adults in private space, does not in any way harm public decency or morality. Therefore, section\n\n377 in its present form violates Article 19(1)(a). The court held that so far as section\n377 penalises any consensual sexual relationship between two adults, be it homosexuals (man and man), heterosexuals (man and woman) or lesbians (woman and woman), cannot be regarded as constitutional. However, if anyone engages in any kind of sexual activity with animal, said aspect of section 377 is constitutional and it shall remain a penal offence. The court held that any act of description covered under section 377 done between two individuals without consent of any one of them would invite penal liability. Further, non-consensual acts which have been criminalised by virtue of section 377 have already been designated as penal offences under section 375 and under POCSO Act, 2012."

Section 375, as substituted by the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013, does not use words 'subject to any other provision of IPC' which indicates that section 375 is not subject to section 377. Criminalisation of carnal intercourse between two adults was held legally unsustainable."

As in rape so also in an unnatural offence even the slightest degree of penetration is enough and it is not necessary to prove the completion of the intercourse by the emission of seed.1271.\nIn a case arising out of unnatural offence, it was held that the acts alleged against the accused falling into two categories (1) sexual intercourse per OS (mouth) and (2) manipulation and movement of penis of the accused whilst being held by the victims in such a way as to create orifice like thing for making manipulated movement of insertion and withdrawal till ejaculation of semen, fell within the sweep of unnatural carnal offences and quashing of proceedings was not warranted.1272.\nThe victim girl aged seven years was in the care and custody of the accused and the offences were committed by him over a period of time. Medical evidence and DNA profile conclusively established commission of natural and unnatural sexual acts on the deceased by the accused. Imposition of the maximum punishment awardable for the said offences, i.e., life imprisonment was held perfectly justified.1273."

Here, as soon as A has severed the tree in order to such taking, he has committed theft.\n\n(b) A puts a bait for dogs in his pocket, and thus induces Z's dog to follow it. Here, if A's intention be dishonestly to take the dog out of Z's possession without Z's consent. A has committed theft as soon as Z's dog has begun to follow A.\n\n(c) A meets a bullock carrying a box of treasure. He drives the bullock in a certain direction, in order that he may dishonestly take the treasure. As soon as the bullock begins to move, A has committed theft of the treasure.\n\n(d) A, being Z's servant, and entrusted by Z with the care of Z's plate, dishonestly runs away with the plate, without Z's consent. A has committed theft.\n\n(e) Z, going on a journey, entrusts his plate to A, the keeper of the warehouse, till Z shall return. A carries the plate to a goldsmith and sells it. Here the plate was not in Z's possession. It could not therefore be taken out of Z's possession, and\n\nA has not committed theft, though he may have committed criminal breach of trust.\n\n(f) A finds a ring belonging to Z on a table in the house which Z occupies. Here the ring is in Z's possession, and if A dishonestly removes it, A commits theft.\n\n(g) A finds a ring lying on the highroad, not in the possession of any person. A by taking it, commits no theft, though he may commit criminal misappropriation of property.\n\n(h) A sees a ring belonging to Z lying on a table in Z's house. Not venturing to misappropriate the ring immediately for fear of search and detection, A hides the ring in a place where it is highly improbable that it will ever be found by Z, with the intention of taking the ring from the hiding place and selling it when the loss is forgotten. Here A, at the time of first moving the ring, commits theft.\n\n(i) A delivers his watch to Z, a jeweller, to be regulated. Z carries it to his shop. A, not owing to the jeweller any debt for which the jeweller might lawfully detain the watch as a security, enters the shop openly, takes his watch by force out of Z's hand, and carries it away. Here A, though he may have committed criminal trespass and assault, has not committed theft, inasmuch as what he did was not done dishonestly.\n\n(j) If A owes money to Z for repairing the watch, and if Z retains the watch lawfully as a security for the debt, and A takes the watch out of Z's possession, with the intention of depriving Z of the property as a security for his debt, he commits theft, inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n\n(k) Again, if A, having pawned his watch to Z, takes it out of Z's possession without Z's consent, not having paid what he borrowed on the watch, he commits theft, though the watch is his own property inasmuch as he takes it dishonestly.\n\n(l) A takes an article belonging to Z out of Z's possession, without Z's consent, with the intention of keeping it until he obtains money from Z as a reward for its restoration. Here A takes dishonestly; A has therefore committed theft.\n\n(m) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent for the purpose merely of reading it, and with the intention of returning it. Here, it is probable that A may have conceived that he had Z's implied consent to use Z's book. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.\n\n(n) A asks charity from Z's wife. She gives A money, food and clothes, which A knows to belong to Z her husband. Here it is probable that A may conceive that Z's wife is authorised to give away alms. If this was A's impression, A has not committed theft.\n\n(o) A is the paramour of Z's wife. She gives A valuable property, which A knows to belong to her husband Z, and to be such property as she has no authority from Z to give. If A takes the property dishonestly, he commits theft.\n\n(p) A, in good faith, believing property belonging to Z to be A's own property, takes\n\nthat property out of B's possession. Here, as A does not take dishonestly, he does not commit theft.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nSection 378 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860) defines 'theft' as the dishonest removal of movable property 'out of the possession of any person' without the consent of that person. 'Theft', has the following ingredients, namely, (i) dishonest intention to take property; (ii) the property must be movable; (ii) it should be taken out of the possession of another person; (iv) it should be taken without the consent of that person; and (v) there must be some moving of the property in order to accomplish the taking of it.\nTo bring home an offence under section 378 IPC, 1860, the prosecution is to prove (a) that there was a movable property; (b) that the said movable property was in the possession of person other than the accused; (c) that the accused took it out or moved it out of the possession of the said person; (d) that the accused did it dishonestly, i.e., with intention to cause wrongful gain to himself or wrongful loss to another; (e) that the accused took the movable property or moved it without the consent of the possessor of the movable property.1\nThe Criminal Court is not required to adjudicate on rival claims of title claimed by the parties. All that the Criminal Court has to decide is whether at the time of the alleged incident the property which is the subject-matter of theft was in the 'possession' of the complainant and whether it was taken out of the possession of the complainant with a dishonest intention.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

      "title": "Punishment for theft.",
      "content": "Whoever commits theft shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nIn order to constitute theft five factors are essential:—\n\n(1) Dishonest intention to take property;\n(2) The property must be movable;\n(3) The property should be taken out of the possession of another person;\n(4) The property should be taken without the consent of that person; and\n(5) There must be some moving of the property in order to accomplish the taking of it.\n1. 'Intending to take dishonestly'.—Intention is the gist of the offence. The intention to take dishonestly exists when the taker intends to cause wrongful gain to one person or wrongful loss to another person. Where, therefore, the accused acting bona fide in the interests of his employers finding a party of fishermen poaching on his master's fisheries, took charge of the nets and retained possession of them, pending the orders of his employers, it was held that he was not guilty of theft.3 When a person seizes cattle on the ground that they were trespassing on his land and causing damage to his crop or produce and gives out that he is taking them to the cattle pound, he commits no offence of theft, and however mistaken he may be about his right to that land or crop. He has no dishonest intention.4 Where a respectable person just pinches the cycle of another person, as his own cycle at the time was missing, and brings it back and the important element of criminal intention is completely absent and he did not intend by his act to cause wrongful gain to himself, it does not amount to theft.5\nThe intention to take dishonestly must exist at the time of the moving of the property [vide ill. (h)]. The taking must be dishonest. It is not necessary that the taking must cause wrongful gain to the talker; it will suffice if it causes wrongful loss to the owner.6. Thus, where the accused took the complainant's three cows against her will and distributed them among her creditors, he was found guilty of stealing.7. It makes no difference in the accused's guilt that the act was not intended to procure any personal benefit to him. Could it be said that a servant would not be guilty of theft if he were to deliver over his master's plate to a pressing tailor, and tell him to pay himself? If the act done was not done animo furtandi, it will not amount to theft. It is no more stealing than it will be to take a stick out of a man's hand to beat him with it.8."

There may be theft without an intention to deprive the owner of the property permanently. Where the accused took out an Indian Air Force plane for an unauthorised flight, even temporarily, it was held that he was guilty of theft.10. It would satisfy the definition of theft if the accused takes away any movable property out of the possession of another person though he intended to return it later on. The accused, who was working in a Government office, removed a file to his house, made it available to an outsider and then returned it to the office after two days. It was held by the Supreme Court that the accused was guilty of theft.11."

      "title": "Bona ﬁde dispute.—",
      "content": "Where property is removed in the assertion of a contested claim of right, however ill- founded that claim may be, the removal thereof does not constitute theft.12. Where the question in dispute between two parties was whether the sale of a mahal (village) carried within its ambit the sale of certain trees and the servant of one of the parties cut and removed the trees under his master's orders under the bona fide belief that they belonged to his master, it was held that the servant was not guilty of theft.13. The dispute as to ownership must be bona fide. A mere colourable pretence to obtain or keep possession of property does not avail as a defence.14. It is not theft if a person, acting under a mistaken notion of law, and believing that certain property is his, and that he has the right to take the same, until payment of the balance of some money due to him from the vendor, removes such property from the possession of the vendee.15. Where a bona fide claim of right exists, it can be a good defence to a prosecution for theft. Thus where the question of possession was in a fluid state and the accused bona fide believed that the crop was his as he had cultivated the land, no offence either of criminal trespass or theft could be made out against him. Such a matter is better decided in a Civil Court.16. However, it was held in a case of dacoity that the question of bona fide claim of right arises only where the accused show to the Court's satisfaction that their belief is reasonable and is based on some documents and title, however weak it may be.17. An act does not amount to theft under such circumstances unless there be not only no legal right but no appearance or colour of a legal right.18."

The element of 'dishonest intention' which is an essential element to constitute the offence of theft cannot be attributed to a person exercising his right under an agreement entered into between the parties as he may not have an intention of causing wrongful gain or to cause wrongful loss to the hirer.21. Because of the fact that status of complainant relating to the vehicle in question having purchased under Hire Purchase Agreement till saturation of the loan amount remains merely a trustee or bailee on behalf of financer and further in the aforesaid background the financer happens to be the real owner of the vehicle till saturation of the loan amount, no prosecution would lie on that score.22.\nThe hire-purchase agreement in law is an executory contract of sale and confers no right in rem on hire until the conditions for transfer of the property to him have been fulfilled.23.\n2. 'Movable property'.—Explanations 1 and 2 state that things attached to the land may become movable property by severance from the earth, and that the act of severance may of itself be theft [vide ill (a)]. Thus, the thief who severs and carries away is put in exactly the same position as if he carried away what had previously been severed. A sale of trees belonging to others and not cut down at the time of sale does not constitute theft.24. But removal of a man's trees that had been blown down by a storm amounts to theft.25.\n\nIt is not necessary that the thing stolen must have some appreciable value."

Transfer of possession of movable property without consent of the person in possession need not, however, be permanent or for a considerable length of time nor is it necessary that the property should be found in possession of the accused. Even a transient transfer of possession is sufficient to meet the requirement of this section.56.\nThe authors of the Code remark: \"We believe it to be impossible to mark with precision, by any words, the circumstances which constitute possession. It is easy to put cases about which no doubt whatever exists, and about which the language of lawyers and of the multitude would be the same. It will hardly be doubted, for example, that a gentleman's watch lying on a table in his room is in his possession, though it is not in his hand, and though he may not know whether it is on his writing-table or on his dressing-table. As little will it be doubted that a watch which a gentleman lost a year ago on a journey, and which he has never heard of since, is not in his possession. It will not be doubted that when a person gives a dinner, his silver forks, while in the hands of his guests, are still in his possession; and it will be as little doubted that his silver forks are not in his possession when he has deposited them with a pawnbroker as a pledge. But between these extreme cases lie many cases in which it is difficult to pronounce, with confidence, either that property is or that it is not in a person's possession.\"57.\nA movable thing is said to be in the possession of a person when he is so situated with respect to it that he has the power to deal with it as owner to the exclusion of all other persons, and when the circumstances are such that he may be presumed to intend to do so in case of need.58."

The right of the owner to get back the vehicle is not affected by the fiction of 'deemed owner' under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The act of taking back the vehicle did not amount to theft.66."

      "content": "Where the complainant had an apparent title as tenant of the land together with long possession, and he had on the strength of this raised the crops which the accused removed, it was held that the accused was guilty of theft because he was not justified in taking the law into his own hands, even if he was entitled to hold the land, as he was not in actual possession of it.68.\nWhere a person takes a lorry on hire-purchase system from a company which under the agreement had reserved the right of seizing the lorry in the event of default in payment of instalments, and default is made, then the company is not entitled to retake possession of the lorry by force or by removing it from the hands of the purchaser's servants who had no authority, express or implied, to give any consent. If the company or its agents do so they are guilty of an offence under this section. The question whether ownership had or had not passed to the purchaser is wholly immaterial as this section deals with possession and not ownership. The legal possession of the lorry was vested in the purchaser and the company was not entitled to recover possession of the lorry, even though default in payment of any instalments had taken place, without the consent of the purchaser. Possession of the driver and the cleaner was the possession of their master and they were not competent to give consent on behalf of the master.69.\n\n4. 'Consent'.—The thing stolen must have been taken without the consent of the person in possession of it. Explanation 5 says that consent may be express or implied, and may be given either by the person in possession, or by any person having for that purpose authority either express or implied [vide ills. (m) and (n)]. But consent given under improper circumstances will be of no avail [vide ill. (c)].

Really speaking, the owner did not consent to the dishonest taking away of the property. He merely assisted the thief in carrying out the latter's dishonest intention. Cf.ills. (m), (n) and (o).

'Moves that property'.—The offence of theft is completed when there is a dishonest moving of the property, even though the property is not detached from that to which it is secured. The least removal of the thing taken from the place where it was before is a sufficient asportation though it is not quite carried off. Upon this principle the guest, who having taken off the sheets from his bed with an intent to steal them carried them into the hall, and was apprehended before he could get out of the house, was adjudged guilty of theft. So also was he, who having taken a horse in a close with intent to steal it, was apprehended before he could get it out of the close.73.\nExplanations 3 and 4 state how 'moving' could be effected in certain cases. Illustrations (b) and (c) elucidate the meaning of Explanation 4.\nIn a prosecution under sections 379/411 in respect of timber seized in a raid the link between the seized timber and the accused was not established nor was any evidence brought to show that the seized timber was transported by the accused under the guise of permits issued to him by the forest department. Acquittal of the accused of the offences under the aforesaid sections was not interfered with.74.\n6. Explanations 1 and 2.—The moving by the same act, which effects the severance, may constitute theft.75. Carrying away of trees after felling them is theft76. but mere sale is not.77. In the case of growing grass, a moving by the same act, which affects its severance from the earth, may amount to theft.78.\nWhere certain land, on which there was a standing crop of paddy, was entrusted to the accused to take care of and watch till the paddy was ripe when they were to give notice\n\nto the factory people who would reap it, it was held that by cutting the crops themselves and disposing of the same, the accused had committed theft.79."

Six months after the theft V innocently purchased the cow, which while in his possession, had a calf. The Magistrate ordered that the cow and the calf should be delivered up by V to R. It was held that, as the calf was not even in embryo at the date of the theft, the order to deliver up the calf was illegal.85.\nIn Karuppanan v Guruswami,86. it was held by the High Court of Madras that where the person accused of theft is acquitted and claims as his own the property seized from him, it should be restored to him in the absence of special reasons to the contrary. The\n\nCourt observed that since it was clear that the learned Sub-Magistrate has over-looked the fundamental principle, that when property is seized from a person who is afterwards acquitted of stealing it, the property should ordinarily be returned to that person.

The plea of Double Jeopardy was rejected holding that both offences are not same in terms of Article 20(2) of the Constitution. A cursory comparison of these two provisions with section 378 of IPC, 1860 would go to show that the ingredients are totally different. The contravention of the terms and conditions of mining lease, etc. constitutes an offence punishable under section 21 of the Mines and Minerals Act, 1957, whereas dishonestly taking any movable property out of the possession of a person without his consent constitutes theft. Thus, it is undoubtedly clear that the ingredients of an offence of theft as defined in s 378 of IPC, 1860 are totally different from the ingredients of an offence punishable under section 21(1) r/w.s. 4 (1) and 4 (1 A) of the Mines and Minerals Act, 1957.90.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.

Theft from a person in a dwelling house will be simple theft under section 379.91.\n1. 'Theft in any building'.—Building means a permanent edifice of some kind. Theft should, under the section, have been committed in any such building. Theft from a veranda,92. or the top of a house,93. or a brake-van,94. is not theft in a building. But where the accused stole some luggage and cash from a railway carriage, when it was at a railway station, it was held that though the railway carriage was not a building, the railway station was, and the accused was therefore, guilty under this section.95. An entrance hall surrounded by a wall in which there were two doorways but no doors, which was used for custody of property, was held to be a building.96. A courtyard97. is, but a compound98. is not, a building. Merely on basis of having possession of some stolen articles, accused cannot be held to be guilty of offences punishable under sections 450 and 380.99."

      "content": "The authors of the Code observe: \"There can be no case of robbery which does not fall within the definition either of theft or of extortion; but in practice it will perpetually be a matter of doubt whether a particular act of robbery was a theft or extortion. A large proportion of robberies will be half theft, half extortion. A seizes Z, threatens to murder him, unless he delivers all his property, and begins to pull off Z's ornaments. Z in terror begs that A will take all he has, and spare his life, assists in taking off his ornaments, and delivers them to A. Here, such ornaments as A took without Z's consent are taken by theft. Those which Z delivered up from fear of death are acquired by extortion. It is by no means improbable that Z's right-arm bracelet may have been obtained by theft, and left-arm bracelet by extortion; that the rupees in Z's girdle may have been obtained by theft, and those in his turban by extortion. Probably in nine-tenths of the robberies which are committed, something like this actually takes place, and it is probable that a few minutes later neither the robber nor the person robbed would be able to recollect in what proportions theft and extortion were mixed in the crime; nor is it at all necessary for the ends of justice that this should be ascertained. For though, in general the consent of a sufferer is a circumstance which vary materially modifies the character of the offence, and which ought, therefore, to be made known to the Courts, yet the consent which a person gives to the taking of his property by a ruffian who holds a pistol to his breast is a circumstance altogether immaterial\".140.\nThe Explanation and illustrations (b) and (c) mark the distinction between simple extortion and extortion which is robbery. Illustration (a) indicates when theft is robbery.\nAn analysis of section 390 IPC, 1860 would show that in order that theft may constitute robbery, prosecution has to establish:\n\n(a) if in order to the committing of theft; or\n(b) in committing the theft; or\n(c) in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by theft; or\n(d) the offender for that end i.e. any of the ends contemplated by (a) to (c); or\n(e) voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint.\nIn other words, theft would only be robbery if for any of the ends mentioned in (a) to (c) the offender voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurl or instant wrongful restraint.\nIf the ends does not fall within (a) to (c) but, the offender still causes or attempts to cause to any person death or hurt or wrongful restraint or fear of instant death or of instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint, the offence would not be robbery. The Court emphasised that (a) or (b) or (c) have to be read conjunctively with (d) and (e). It is only\n\nwhen (a) or (b) or (c) co-exist with (d) and (e) or there is a nexus between any of them and (d) and (e) would theft amount to robbery.141."

      "content": "Theft or extortion when caused with violence causing death or fear of death, hurt or wrongful restraint is robbery. When there is no theft, as a natural corollary, there cannot be robbery. Robbery is only an aggravated form of theft or extortion. Aggravation is in the use of violence causing death or fear of death, hurt or restraint. Violence must be in the course of theft and not subsequently. Also, it is not necessary that violence should actually be committed, even attempt to commit it is enough.142.\n1. 'Carrying away'.—Even if death, hurt or wrongful restraint, or fear of any of these, is caused after committing theft, in order to carry away the property obtained by theft, this offence would be committed.\n2. 'For that end'.—Death, hurt or wrongful restraint must be caused in committing theft, or in carrying away property obtained by theft. The expression \"for that end\" clearly means that the hurt caused by the offender must be with the object of facilitating the committing of theft or must be caused while the offender is committing theft or is carrying away or is attempting to carry away property obtained by theft.143. Where a person caused hurt only to avoid capture when surprised while stealing144. it was held that theft, and not robbery, was committed. The use of violence will not convert the offence of theft into robbery, unless the violence is committed for one of the ends specified in this section. Where the accused abandoned the property obtained by theft and threw stones at his pursuer to deter him from continuing the pursuit, it was held that the accused was guilty of theft and not of robbery.145. The victim was relieved of his watch in a running train by one of the two accused who were associates in crime. As the snatcher was trying to get down from the train, the victim raised alarm. Whereupon the second accused gave a slap to the victim. It was held that the hurt caused was directly related to the theft i.e., to facilitate carrying away of the property obtained by theft and as such the accused were rightly convicted under section 392, IPC, 1860.146.\n\n3. 'Voluntarily causes'.—These words denote that an accidental infliction of injury by a thief will not convert his offence into robbery. Thus, where a person while cutting a string, by which a basket was tied, with intent to steal it, accidentally cut the wrist of the owner, who at the moment tried to seize and keep the basket, and ran away with it, it was held that the offence committed was theft and not robbery.147. But where in committing theft, there is indubitably an intention seconded by an attempt to cause hurt, the offence is robbery.148. In order to make an offence of theft a robbery there must be either theft and injury or threat of injury while committing theft.149.\n\n4. 'Person'.—The word 'person' cannot be so narrowly construed as to exclude the dead body of a human being who was killed in the course of the same transaction in which theft was committed.150."

      "title": "Dacoity.",
      "content": "When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission or attempt, amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit \"dacoity\".\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nDacoity is robbery committed by five or more persons, otherwise there is no difference between dacoity and robbery. The gravity of the offence consists in the terror it causes by the presence of a number of offenders. Abettors who are present and aiding when the crime is committed are counted in the number. Section 391 IPC, 1860 explains the offence of 'dacoity'. When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission and attempt amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit 'dacoity'. Under section 392 IPC, 1860, the offence of 'robbery' simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to ten years or 14 years depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 396 IPC, 1860 brings within its ambit a murder committed along with 'dacoity'. In terms of this provision, if any one of the five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is clear that to constitute an offence of 'dacoity', robbery essentially should be committed by five or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of 'dacoity with murder' any one of the five or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity, then every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by fiction of law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable for punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.153.\nDacoity is perhaps the only offence which the Legislature has made punishable at four stages. When five or more persons assemble for the purpose of committing a dacoity, each of them is punishable under section 402 merely on the ground of joining the assembly. Another stage is that of preparation and if any one makes preparation to commit a dacoity, he is punishable under section 399. The definition of 'dacoity' in this section shows that the other two stages, namely, the stage of attempting to commit and the stage of actual commission of robbery, have been treated alike, and come within the definition.154. In other words, attempt to commit dacoity is also dacoity.\n\n\"It will, therefore, be seen that it is possible to commit the offence of dacoity under section 395, IPC, 1860, by merely attempting to commit a robbery by five or more persons without being successful in getting any booty whatsoever. Thus, if in a particular case the dacoits are forced to retreat due to stiff opposition from the inmates or villagers without collecting any booty, then it must be held that the offence of dacoity is completed the moment the dacoits take to their heels without any booty\".155. Even in such a case all the dacoits can be convicted and punished under section 395, IPC, 1860.156.\n\nIn a case of dacoity the circumstance that the inmates of the house, seeing the large number of dacoits, do not offer any resistance and no force or violence is required or used does not reduce the dacoity to theft.157."

They were apprehended and, on the basis of their statements, stolen articles were recovered. Identification of the accused persons and the articles was made by the victim at TI parade. The conviction of the accused person was held to be proper.162.\nWhere there were only five named accused who committed the dacoity and out of five two were acquitted holding that only three took part in the offence, it was held that the remaining three could not be convicted of dacoity, as the offence of dacoity could not be committed by less than five persons.163. Where in spite of the acquittal of a number of persons, it is found as a fact that along with the persons convicted there were other unidentified persons who participated in the offence, bringing the total number of participants to five or more, it was held that the conviction of the identified persons, though less than five, was perfectly correct.164. Recovery of articles shortly after a dacoity at the instance of the accused persons has been held by the Supreme Court to be sufficient for conviction under section 396 as well as under section 412.165.\n\n\n\n\n\n153.

Section 397 similarly provides for the minimum sentence of imprisonment which must be inflicted when grievous hurt is caused.\nCommenting on the section, the Supreme Court observed: section 394 prescribes punishment for voluntarily causing hurt in committing or attempting to commit robbery. The offence under section 394 is a more serious than one under section 392. Section 394 postulates and contemplates the causing of harm during commission of robbery or in attempting to commit robbery when such causing of hurt is hardly necessary to facilitate the commission of robbery. Section 394 applies to cases where during the course of robbery voluntary hurt is caused. Section 394 classifies two distinct classes of persons. Firstly, those who actually cause hurt and secondly, those who do not actually cause hurt but are \"jointly concerned\" in the commission of the offence of robbery. The second class of persons may not be concerned in the causing of hurt, but they become liable independently of the knowledge of its likelihood or a reasonable belief in its probability.178.\nIn a prosecution for robbery and murder, injuries were caused to the deceased in the process of removing earrings. The Court said that the fact that the booty was distributed among three accused and they had secreted the robbed articles. These things revealed the common intention to commit robbery. One of them picked up a stone piece and caused death of the victim. There was nothing to show that the accused even knew of any such possibility. Others could not be convicted of murder and robbery with the help of presumption under section 114 Evidence Act, 1872. They were liable to be convicted only under sections 394/34.179."

The Bank should resort to\n\nprocedure recognized by law to take possession of vehicles in cases where the borrower may have committed default in payment of the instalments instead of taking resort to strong-arm tactics.

As an obvious corollary, section 397 had no application to the case where robbery was not actually completed. Even so, measure of punishment had to be regulated by section 398 of the IPC, 1860 that provides for minimum punishment of seven years imprisonment in a case of attempt to commit robbery when armed with deadly weapon. In this view of the matter, the conviction of the appellants for the offence under section 394 read with section 397 of the IPC, 1860 deserves to be converted into one under section 394 read with section 398 of the IPC, 1860.184."

      "content": "Whoever commits dacoity shall be punished with 187.[imprisonment for life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\n188..—When a person is involved in an offence of theft of higher magnitude, then it becomes dacoity and when dacoity is committed with murder and also results in causing grievous hurt to others, it becomes robbery punishable under sections 395, section 396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860. In other words, when the offence of theft is committed conjointly by five or more persons, it becomes dacoity and such dacoity by those persons also results in commission of murder as well as causing of grievous hurt to the victims, it results in an offence of robbery. A reading of section 395, section 396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860 makes the position clear that by virtue of the conjoint effort of the accused while indulging in the said offence, makes every one of them deemed to have committed the offence of dacoity and robbery. In the result, when such offences of dacoity and robbery are committed, the same result in the death of a person or hurt or wrongful restrain or creating fear of instant death or instant hurt or instant wrongful restraint. In substance, in order to find a person guilty of offences committed under sections 395, 396 and 397 of IPC, 1860, his participation along with a group of five or more persons indulging in robbery and in that process commits murder and also attempts to cause death or grievous hurt with deadly weapons would be sufficient. Use of a knife in the course of commission of such a crime has always been held to be use of a deadly weapon. Keeping the above basic prescription of the offence described in the above provisions in mind, we examined the case on hand. In the first instance, what is to be examined is whether the basic ingredient of the offence falling under section 395, section 396 and section 397 of IPC, 1860, namely, participation of five or more persons was made out.189."

      "content": "If any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death, or 193.[imprisonment for life], or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nUnder this section extreme penalty of death may be inflicted on a person convicted of taking part in a dacoity in the course of which a murder is committed, even though there is nothing to show that he himself committed the murder or that he abetted it. The section declares the liability of other persons as co-extensive with the one who has actually committed murder. Where in the course of a dacoity one man was shot dead, and the accused person who was tried had a gun and others of the dacoits also had guns, and there was no evidence that the accused was the man who fired the fatal shot, the sentence was altered from one of death to one of transportation for life.194."
    },
    "section396.1": {
      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "The offence under this section requires two things:—\n\n(1) The dacoity must be the joint act of the persons concerned.\n(2) Murder must have been committed in the course of the commission of the dacoity.195.\nSection 391 IPC, 1860 explains the offence of 'dacoity'. When five or more persons conjointly commit or attempt to commit a robbery, or where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission and attempt amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit 'dacoity'. Under section 392 IPC, 1860, the offence of 'robbery' simpliciter is punishable with rigorous imprisonment which may extend to ten years or 14 years depending upon the facts of a given case. Section 396 IPC, 1860 brings within its ambit a murder committed along with 'dacoity'. In terms of this provision, if any one of the five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity, every one of those persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be liable to fine.196. In the first instance, what is to be examined is whether the basic ingredient of the offence falling under sections 395, 396 and 397 of IPC, 1860, namely, participation of five or more persons was made out.197. On a plain reading of these provisions, it is\n\nclear that to constitute an offence of 'dacoity', robbery essentially should be committed by five or more persons. Similarly, to constitute an offence of 'dacoity with murder' any one of the five or more persons should commit a murder while committing the dacoity, then every one of such persons so committing, attempting to commit or aiding, by fiction of law, would be deemed to have committed the offence of murder and be liable for punishment provided under these provisions depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case.198.\nFor recording conviction for dacoity, there must be five or more persons. In the absence of such finding, an accused cannot be convicted for dacoity. In a given case, however, it may happen that there may be five or more persons and the factum of five or more persons is either not disputed or is clearly established, but the Court may not be able to record a finding as to identity of all the persons said to have committed the dacoity and may not be able to convict them and order their acquittal observing that their identity is not established. In such case, conviction of less than five persons—or even one—can stand. But in the absence of such finding, less than five persons cannot be convicted for dacoity. A similar situation arises in dealing with cases of \"unlawful assembly\" as defined in section 141 IPC, 1860 and liability of every member of such unlawful assembly for an offence committed in prosecution of common object under section 149 IPC, 1860. In this case there were six accused. Out of those six accused, two were acquitted by the trial Court without recording a finding that though offence of dacoity was committed by six persons, identity of two accused could not be established. They were simply acquitted by the Court. Therefore, as per settled law, four persons could not be convicted for dacoity, being less than five which is an essential ingredient for commission of dacoity. Moreover, all of them were acquitted for an offence of criminal conspiracy punishable under section 120-B IPC, 1860 as also for receiving stolen property in the commission of dacoity punishable under section 412 IPC, 1860. The conviction of the appellant in this case for an offence punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860, therefore, could not stand and must be set aside.199."

      "content": "The section says that if \"any one of five or more persons, who are conjointly committing dacoity, commits murder in so committing dacoity\" then every one of those persons shall be liable to the penalty prescribed in the section. It is not necessary that murder should be committed in the presence of all. When in the commission of a dacoity a murder is committed, it matters not whether the particular dacoit was inside the house where the dacoity is committed, or outside the house, or whether the murder was committed inside or outside the house, so long only as the murder was committed in the commission of that dacoity.200. The essence of an offence under this section is murder committed in commission of dacoity. It does not matter whether murder is committed in the immediate presence of a particular person or persons. It is not even necessary that murder should have been within the previous contemplation of the perpetrators of the crime.201. But in a case the dacoits were forced to retreat without collecting any booty, the offence of dacoity would be completed as soon as they left the house of occurrence and took to their heels. And if a murder was committed by any one of the dacoits in course of such a retreat without any booty, then only the actual murderer will be liable under section 302, IPC, 1860, and conjoint responsibility under section 396, IPC, 1860, could not be fixed on others though all of them could be convicted under section 395, IPC, 1860 as attempt to commit dacoity is also dacoity.202."

The nature of the presumption under Illustration (a) of section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 must depend upon the nature of evidence adduced. No fixed time-limit can be laid down to determine whether possession is recent or otherwise. Each case must be judged on its own facts. The question as to what amounts to recent possession sufficient to justify the presumption of guilt varies according \"as the stolen article is or is not calculated to pass readily from hand to hand\". If the stolen articles were such as were not likely to pass readily from hand to hand, the period of one year that elapsed could not be said to be too long particularly when the appellant had been absconding during that period.206."

    "section396.5": {
      "title": "Section 396 and Section 302.—",
      "content": "The ingredients of both these offences, to some extent, are also different in as much as to complete an offence of 'dacoity' under section 396 IPC, 1860, five or more persons must conjointly commit the robbery while under section 302 of the IPC, 1860 even one person by himself can commit the offence of murder. But, as already noticed, to attract the provisions of section 396, the offence of 'dacoity' must be coupled with murder. In other words, the ingredients of section 302 become an integral part of the offences punishable under section 396 of the IPC, 1860. Resultantly, the distinction with regard to the number of persons involved in the commission of the crime loses its significance as it is possible that the offence of 'dacoity' may not be proved but still the offence of murder could be established, like in the present case. Upon reasonable analysis of the language of these provisions, it is clear that the Court has to keep in mind the ingredients which shall constitute a criminal offence within the meaning of the penal section. This is not only essential in the case of the offence charged with but even where there is comparative study of different penal provisions as the accused may have committed more than one offence or even offences of a graver nature. He may finally be punished for a lesser offence or vice versa, if the law so permits and the requisite ingredients are satisfied.207. On the conjoint reading of sections 396 and 302 IPC, 1860, it is clear that the offence of murder has been lifted and incorporated in the provisions of section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, the offence of murder punishable under section 302 and as defined under section 300 will have to be read into the provisions of offences stated under section 396 IPC, 1860. In other words, where a provision is physically lifted and made part of another provision, it shall fall within the ambit and scope of principle akin to 'legislation by incorporation' which normally is\n\napplied between an existing statute and a newly enacted law. The expression 'murder' appearing in section 396 would have to take necessarily in its ambit and scope the ingredients of section 300 of the IPC, 1860. The provisions are clear and admit no scope for application of any other principle of interpretation except the 'golden rule of construction', i.e., to read the statutory language grammatically and terminologically in the ordinary and primary sense which it appears in its context without omission or addition. These provisions read collectively, put the matter beyond ambiguity that the offence of murder, is by specific language, included in the offences under section 396. It will have the same connotation, meaning and ingredients as are contemplated under the provisions of section 302 IPC, 1860.208."

The circumstances which constitute an offence under section 302 were literally put to him, as section 302 IPC, 1860 itself is an integral part of an offence punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860. Once the appellant has not suffered any prejudice, much less a serious prejudice, then the conviction of the appellant under section 302 IPC, 1860 cannot be set aside merely for want of framing of a specific/ alternate charge for an offence punishable under section 302 IPC, 1860. It is more so because the dimensions and facets of an offence under section 302 are incorporated by specific language and are inbuilt in the offence punishable under section 396 IPC, 1860.

This section fixes a minimum term of imprisonment when the commission of robbery and dacoity has been attended with certain aggravating circumstances, viz., (1) the use of a deadly weapon, or (2) the causing of grievous hurt, or (3) attempting to cause death or grievous hurt.\n\nSection 34 of the Code has no application in the construction of this section.213."

The liability to enhanced punishment is limited to the offender who actually uses the weapon himself and causes grievous hurt and not to others who in combination with such person have committed robbery or dacoity.215. The expression 'the offender' occurring in this section pertains to actual offender. It does not include all persons who participate in robbery or dacoity.216. The section does not provide for constructive liability as in section 149.217.\n1. 'Uses any deadly weapon'.—These words are wide enough to include a case in which a person levels his revolver against another person in order to overawe him. It is not correct to say that a person does not use a revolver unless he fires it.218. Where the accused carried knife open to the view of the victims, it is sufficient use of a deadly weapon to terrorise them within the meaning of this section and no other overt act as brandishing of the knife is necessary to apply this section.219. In reference to the word \"uses\" as it occurs in the section, it has been held that if the weapon carried by the offender was within the vision of the victim so as to be capable of creating terror in his mind that is sufficient to satisfy the requirement of use of deadly weapon. It is not necessary to show further any hurt caused by the use of the weapon.220.\n\nThe section postulates only the individual act of the accused to be relevant. It thus negates the application of the principle of constructive or vicarious liability as provided in section 34. Where all the accused persons carried their respective deadly weapons, it\n\nwas held that each one of them satisfy the requirement of section 397. Conviction could be only under section 397 and not section 397 read with section 34.221."

      "title": "Attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with deadly weapon.",
      "content": "If, at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, the imprisonment with which such offender shall be punished shall not be less than seven years.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section can regulate the punishment only in cases of an attempt to commit robbery as distinguished from a case in which the offender has accomplished his purpose and robbery has actually been committed.231. It applies to such of the offenders as are armed with deadly weapons though they do not use them in the attempt to rob or commit dacoity. It does not apply to other offenders who in combination with such persons have committed robbery or dacoity.232. The words \"uses\" and \"is armed\" in sections 397 and 398, IPC, 1860, have to be given identical meaning to resolve apparent anomaly.233. Thus, carrying a deadly weapon would be enough to attract the mischief of either section. In the charge-sheet, accused were charged under section 396. Section 398 is referred only for the purpose of sentence. Hence, the argument that when section 398 is attracted, life imprisonment cannot be awarded is untenable. Substantive offence here is section 396. But, if section 398 is attracted, minimum punishment shall be seven years. Sections 397 and 398 cannot be used conjunctively or constructively as held by the Apex Court in Paramjeet Singh v State of Rajasthan.234. In fact, as held in various Court decisions, a person cannot be convicted under section 398 unless he is armed with a deadly weapon while committing or attempting to commit robbery or dacoity.235.\n\nSection 398, IPC, 1860 gets attracted if at the time of attempting to commit robbery or dacoity, the offender is armed with a deadly weapon which will attract an imprisonment not less than seven years. When no robbery or dacoity has been committed as such, in the sense that no property was removed from the house of the complainants and nothing said to be belonging to the complainants was recovered, it would be difficult to hold that there was any attempt in regard to the commission of robbery or dacoity. Scattering of articles in the house may cause a scene as if ransacked, but that does not proved the charge.236. For the offence of attempt to commit robbery the maximum punishment prescribed by law is rigorous imprisonment for seven years with fine. However the discretion is left to the Court to quantify the actual sentence to be awarded. However, if at the time of attempting to commit robbery the offender is armed with any deadly weapon, the offence becomes more serious or aggravated and therefore, section 398 provides that in such circumstances the imprisonment with which, the offender shall be punishable, shall not be less than seven years. If at the time of committing robbery the offender is not armed with any deadly weapon the Court may award sentence of imprisonment for a term up to seven years and if he was\n\narmed with deadly weapon the sentence of imprisonment shall not be less than seven years. In such circumstances the maximum sentence of rigorous imprisonment of seven years has to be awarded. It is well settled that section 398 IPC, 1860 does not create any offence but merely regulates the punishment already provided for robbery or dacoity. One cannot be convicted and sentenced separately under sections 393 and 398 of IPC, 1860.237."

There can be cases where there may be an assembly for the purpose of dacoity without even a fringe of preparation. The mere fact that the appellants are acquitted of the charge under section 399 is no ground to knock off the charge under section 402, IPC, 1860.242. In order to establish an offence punishable under section 399, IPC, 1860 some act amounting to preparation must be proved and what must be proved further is an act for which preparation was being made was a dacoity, that is to say, robbery to be committed by five or more persons. The prosecution has to establish under section 402, IPC, 1860 that there had been an assembly of five or more persons constituted for the purpose of committing dacoity and that the accused persons were members of that assembly. If there is no clear and acceptable evidence of any assemblage of the appellants with three or more persons\n\nfor the purpose of committing dacoity then the appellants cannot be held liable under section 402, IPC, 1860.243."

If the attempt succeeds, he has committed the offence; if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have attempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary Intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence. The word \"attempt\" is not itself defined, and must, therefore, be taken in its ordinary meaning. This is exactly what the provisions of section 511 require. An attempt to commit a crime is to be distinguished from an intention to commit it and from preparation made for its commission. Mere intention to commit an offence, not followed by any act, cannot constitute an offence. The will is not be taken for the deed unless there be some external act which shows that progress, has been made in the direction of it, or towards maturing and effecting it. Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon considering the motives which suggest the choice. Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of the offence. It differs widely from attempt which is the direct movement towards the commission after preparations are made. Preparation to commit an offence is punishable only when the preparation is to commit offences under section 122 (waging war against the Government of India) and section 399 (preparation to commit dacoity). The dividing, line between a mere preparation and an attempt is sometimes thin and has to be decided on the facts of each case. There is a greater degree of determination in attempt as compared with preparation.244."

      "content": "Whoever, at any time after the passing of this Act, shall belong to a gang of persons associated for the purpose of habitually committing dacoity, shall be punished with 249.[imprisonment for life], or with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThis section provides for the punishment of those who belong to a gang of persons who make it their business to commit dacoity. Its object is to break up gangs of dacoits by punishing persons associated for the purpose of committing dacoity. The mere fact that women lived as wives or mistresses with men who were dacoits was held not sufficient to prove that they belonged to a gang of persons associated for the purpose of habitually committing dacoity within the meaning of this section, unless it be proved that the women themselves were associated with the husbands or protectors for the purpose of themselves habitually committing dacoities.250.\nThe expression 'belong' implies something more than casual association for the purpose of committing one or two dacoities by a person who was ordinarily living by honest means. It refers to those persons who habitually associate with a gang of dacoits and actively assist them in their operations. But if a person with a bad past record participates in the commission of dacoity even on one occasion in association with a well-known gang of habitual dacoits knowing them to be such a gang, it may be reasonably inferred that he belongs to that gang unless there is some other material on record to justify an inference that the association was of a casual nature.251.\nThe word 'gang' means any band or company of persons who go about together or act in concert. The essence of the word is that the persons should act in concert.252.

A is not guilty of theft; but if A, after discovering his mistake, dishonestly appropriates the property to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.\n\n(b) A, being on friendly terms with Z, goes into Z's library in Z's absence, and takes away a book without Z's express consent. Here, if A was under the impression that he had Z's implied consent to take the book for the purpose of reading it, A has not committed theft. But, if A afterwards sells the book for his own benefit, he is guilty of an offence under this section.\n\n(c) A and B, being joint owners of a horse, A takes the horse out of B's possession, intending to use it. Here, as A has a right to use the horse, he does not dishonestly misappropriate it. But, if A sells the horse and appropriates the whole proceeds to his own use, he is guilty of an offence under this section.\nExplanation 1.—A dishonest misappropriation for a time only is a misappropriation within the meaning of this section.\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA finds a Government promissory note belonging to Z, bearing a blank endorsement. A, knowing that the note belongs to Z, pledges it with a banker as a security for a loan, intending at a future time to restore it to Z. A has committed an offence under this section.\nExplanation 2.—A person who finds property not in the possession of any other person, and takes such property for the purpose of protecting it for, or of restoring it to, the owner does not take or misappropriate it dishonestly, and is not guilty of an offence; but he is guilty of the offence above defined, if he appropriates it to his own use, when he knows or has the means of discovering the owner, or before he has used reasonable means to discover and give notice to the owner and has kept the property a reasonable time to enable the owner to claim it.\nWhat are reasonable means or what is a reasonable time in such a case, is a question of fact.\n\nIt is not necessary that the finder should know who is the owner of the property, or that any particular person is the owner of it; it is suﬃcient if, at the time of appropriating it, he does not believe it to be his own property, or in good faith believes that the real owner cannot be found.\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A finds a rupee on the high road, not knowing to whom the rupee belongs. A picks up the rupee. Here A has not committed the offence defined in this section.\n\n(b) A finds a letter on the road, containing a banknote. From the direction and contents of the letter he learns to whom the note belongs. He appropriates the note. He is guilty of an offence under this section.\n\n(c) A finds a cheque payable to bearer. He can form no conjecture as to the person who has lost the cheque. But the name of the person, who has drawn the cheque, appears. A knows that this person can direct him to the person in whose favour the cheque was drawn. A appropriates the cheque without attempting to discover the owner. He is guilty of an offence under this section.\n\n(d) A sees Z drop his purse with money in it. A picks up the purse with the intention of restoring it to Z, but afterwards appropriates it to his own use. A has committed an offence under this section.\n\n(e) A finds a purse with money, not knowing to whom it belongs; he afterwards discovers that it belongs to Z, and appropriates it to his own use. A is guilty of an offence under this section.\n\n(f) A finds a valuable ring, not knowing to whom it belongs. A sells it immediately without attempting to discover the owner. A is guilty of an offence under this section.\n\n\n\n(2) Such property must be movable. Section 403 deals with the offence of dishonest misappropriation of property. It provides that \"whoever dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use any movable property\", shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or both. The basic requirement for attracting the section is: (i) the movable property in question should belong to a person other than the accused; (ii) the accused should wrongly appropriate or convert such property to his own use; and (iii) there should be dishonest intention on the part of the accused. Here again the basic requirement is that the subject matter of dishonest misappropriation or conversion should be someone else's movable property. When NEPC India owns/possesses the aircraft, it obviously cannot 'misappropriate or convert to its own use' such aircraft or parts thereof. Therefore, section 403 is also not attracted.260. Section 403 uses the words 'dishonestly' and 'misappropriate'. These are necessary ingredients of an offence under section 403, IPC, 1860.261.\n1. 'Dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use'.—There must be actual conversion of the thing misappropriated to the accused's own use. Where, therefore, the accused found a thing, and merely retained it in his possession, he was acquitted of this offence.262. Where the accused found a purse on the pavement of a temple in a crowded gathering and put it in his pocket but was immediately after arrested, it was held that he was not guilty of criminal misappropriation, for it could not be assumed that by the mere act of picking up the purse or putting it in his pocket he intended to appropriate its contents to his own use.263. Where a person took possession of a bullock which had strayed, but there was no evidence that it was stolen property, and he dishonestly retained it, he could be convicted under this section and not under section 411.264. The accused purchased for one anna, from a child aged six years, two pieces of cloth valued at 15 annas, which the child had taken from the house of a third person. It was held that assuming that a charge of dishonest reception of property (section 411) could not be sustained owing to the incapacity of the child to commit an offence, the accused was guilty of criminal misappropriation, if he knew that the property belonged to the child's guardian and dishonestly appropriated it to his own use.265."

Two distinct parts are involved in the commission of the offence of criminal breach of trust. The first part consists of the creation of an obligation in relation to the property over which dominion or control is acquired by the accused. The second is the misappropriation or dealing with the property dishonestly and contrary to the terms of the obligation created.283. A trust contemplated by section 405 would arise only when there is an entrustment of property or dominion over property. There has, therefore, to be a property belonging to someone which is entrusted to the person accused of the offence under section 405. The entrustment of property creates a trust which is only an obligation annexed to the ownership of the property and arises out of a confidence reposed and accepted by the owner.284. However, it must be borne in mind that section 405 IPC, 1860 does not contemplate the creation of a trust with all the technicalities of the law of trust. It contemplates the creation of a relationship whereby the owner of property makes it over to another person to be retained by him until a certain contingency arises or to be disposed of by him on the happening of a certain event.285.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n278.

Such an act must not only be done dishonestly but also in violation of any direction of law or any contract express or implied relating to carrying out the trust.286. To constitute this offence there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is placed as to the custody or management of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is charged. The ownership or beneficial interest in the property in respect of which criminal breach of trust is alleged to have been committed must be in some person other than the accused and the latter must hold it on account of some person or in some way for his benefit.287. The offence of criminal breach of trust closely resembles the offence of embezzlement under the English law. Offences committed by trustees with regard to trust property fall within the purview of this section.\nA partner has undefined ownership along with other partners over all the assets of the partnership. If he chooses to use any of them for his own purpose he may be accountable civilly to other partners. But he does not thereby commit any misappropriation. A partner may have dominion over the partnership property. But mere dominion is not enough. It must further be shown that his dominion was the result of entrustment. Thus to prosecute a partner the prosecution must establish that dominion over the assets or a particular asset of the partnership was by a special agreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused partner. If in the absence of such a special agreement a partner receives money belonging to the partnership he cannot be said to have received it in a fiduciary capacity or in other words cannot be held to have been entrusted with dominion over partnership properties and without entrustment there cannot be any criminal breach of trust.288. The Supreme Court has reiterated that where a partner is entrusted with property under special contract and he holds that property in a fiduciary capacity, any misappropriation of that property would amount to criminal breach of trust.289."

      "content": "In criminal misappropriation the property comes into the possession of the offender by some casualty or otherwise, and he afterwards misappropriates it. In the case of criminal breach of trust the offender is lawfully entrusted with the property, and he dishonestly misappropriates the same, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do, instead of discharging the trust attached to it.\n1. 'Being in any manner entrusted with property'.—The words \"in any manner\" do not enlarge the term \"entrustment\" itself and, unless there is entrustment, the transaction in question cannot be affected by the terms of that section.292. The word 'entrusted' is not a term of law. In its most general significance all it imports is a handing over of the possession for some purpose which may not imply the conferring of any proprietary right at all.293. The natural meaning of 'entrusted' involves that the assured should by some real and conscious volition have imposed on the person, to whom he delivers the goods, some species of fiduciary duty.294. The expression \"entrustment\" carries with it the implication that the person handing over any property or on whose behalf that property is handed over to another, continues to be its owner. Further, the person handing over property must have confidence in the person taking the property so as to create a fiduciary relationship between them.295.\n\nOnce entrustment is proved, the prosecution has not to prove any misappropriation. It is for the accused to prove in his defence that there was no misappropriation. The offence becomes proved when it is shown that the money has not been applied to the purpose for which it was entrusted.296."

    "section406.4": {
      "title": "'Property'.—",
      "content": "The word 'property' is used in the Code in a much wider sense than the expression 'movable property'. There is no good reason to restrict the meaning of the word 'property' to movable property only when it is used without any qualification in this section or other sections of the Penal Code.299. The offence of criminal breach of trust is committed not only by dishonest conversion, but also by dishonest use or disposition, and there is nothing in the wording of this section to exempt from the definition of criminal breach of trust dishonest use of immovable property by the person entrusted with dominion over it.\nIn cases of criminal breach of trust a distinction has to be drawn between the person entrusted with property and one having control or general charge over the property. In case of the former, if it is found that the property is missing, without further proof, the person so entrusted will be liable to account for it. In the latter case, that person will be liable only when it is shown that he misappropriated it or was a party to criminal breach of trust committed in respect of that property by any other person.300.\n2. 'Dishonestly misappropriates'.—A temporary misappropriation may also constitute a criminal breach of trust. The bank officials in this case made public money available to a private party contrary to statutory provisions and Departmental instructions. The dishonest intention was self-evident.301. Terms of section 405 are very wide. They apply to one who is in any manner entrusted with property or dominion over property. Section 405 does not require that trust should be in furtherance of any lawful object. It merely provides that a person commits criminal breach of trust if he dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use the property entrusted to him.302."

      "content": "Criminal or dishonest intention is a sine qua non in an offence of criminal breach of trust. This being so the prosecution has to show that the accused dishonestly misappropriated or converted to his own use or dishonestly disposed of property entrusted to him. The prosecution must prove 'entrustment' or 'domino' over the property with the person proceeded and the person so entrusted has dishonestly misappropriated or converted that property. Even if the prosecution succeeds in proving entrustment, it would fail to establish the offence against the accused, if it fails to prove that he has misappropriated the property entrusted303.\n\nIt has been held that a mere error of judgment does not attract criminal liability.304."

    "section406.6": {
      "title": "Wilful omission to account.—",
      "content": "Similarly, \"in the case of a servant charged with misappropriating the goods of his master the elements of criminal offence of misappropriation will be established if the prosecution proves that the servant received the goods, that he was under a duty to account to his master and had not done so. If the failure to account was due to an accidental loss the facts being within the servant's knowledge, it is, for him to explain the loss\".305. In JM Desai's case the matter was further clarified by the Supreme Court to say, \"conviction of a person for the offence of criminal breach of trust may not in all cases be founded merely on his failure to account for the property entrusted to him, or over which he has dominion, even when a duty to account is imposed upon him, but where he is unable to account or renders an explanation for his failure to account which is untrue an inference of misappropriation with dishonest intent may readily be made\".306.\nMere retention of goods by a person without misappropriation does not constitute criminal breach of trust.307.\n3. 'Dishonestly uses or disposes of that property'.— To constitute the offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under section 406 of the IPC, 1860, there must be dishonest misappropriation by a person in whom confidence is placed as to the custody or management of the property in respect of which the breach of trust is charged. The misappropriation or conversion or disposal must be with a dishonest intention. Every breach of trust gives rise to a suit for damages, but it is only when there is evidence of a mental act of fraudulent misappropriation that the commission of embezzlement of any sum of money becomes a penal offence punishable as criminal breach of trust. It is this mental act of fraudulent misappropriation that clearly demarcates an act of embezzlement which is a civil wrong or tort, from the offence of criminal breach of trust. In the present case, apparently the prosecution has failed to establish the offence of cheating and criminal breach of trust in the absence of mens rea. In such view of the matter, the accused persons could not have been convicted.308.\n3A. In violation of any direction of law.—The criminal breach of trust would, inter alia, mean using or disposing of the property by a person who is entrusted with or has otherwise dominion there over. Such an act must not only be done dishonestly but also in violation of any direction of law or any contract express or implied relating to carrying out the trust. A direction of law need not be a law made by the Parliament or a Legislature; it may be made by an authority having the power therefor; the law could be a subordinate legislation, a notification or even a custom.309. It has been held that the expression \"direction of law\", even if taken literally, would include a direction issued by authorities in exercise of their statutory power as also power of supervision. Failure on the part of bank officials to follow RBI instructions and provisions of a Departmental Manual was a violation of a direction of law amounting to criminal breach of trust. The Manual was the UCO Bank Manual of Instructions on Bill Discounting.310.\nIt has been held that the expression \"direction of law\" in section 405 includes banking norms, practices and directions given in internal Departmental instructions of a bank. Bank officials who allowed advance credits on banker's cheques to a customer in violation of Departmental instructions acted in violation of direction of law. The officials had dominion over the money belonging to the bank and they dishonestly used that money for conferring a benefit on the customer. They were held guilty of the offence under the section.311."

According to the Supreme Court the prosecution must establish that dominion over the assets or a particular asset of the partnership was by a special agreement between the parties, entrusted to the accused partner. Where the partner of a firm had taken away some VCRs and cassettes, a criminal complaint was not allowed, the loss to the firm being essentially of civil nature and, therefore, civil proceedings would have been more appropriate.313. Signing of contracts on behalf of the firm particularly when the partnership deed authorised partners to sign documents on behalf of others was held to be not constituting a criminal breach of trust.314.

The offence alleged in the criminal complaint filed by respondent is under sections 405 and 420 IPC, 1860 where under no specific liability is imposed on the officers of the company, if the alleged offence is by the Company. In the absence of specific details about the same, no person other than Company can be prosecuted under the alleged complaint.317.\n\nThe complainant was the wholesale dealer of the company. His dealership was terminated. Even so he sent a demand draft to the company for supply of goods. He did so because his dealership was subsequently reinstated by the company. The proprietor of the dealer firm filed a complaint alleged offence by the company because neither it supplied the goods nor returned the money. The company's application for quashing the complaint was rejected because the offence was prima facie made out. The Supreme Court said that only the company could be made liable but not its managing director or any other employee. The Supreme Court reversed the order of the High Court.

It was further held that offering of 25 lakh rupees for grant of divorce by mutual consent as compensation to the complainant did not per se constitute any offence under the section. Any gift made to the bridegroom or her parents, whether in accordance with any custom or law also did not constitute an offence under the section.

When dispute between the parties constitute only a civil wrong and not a criminal wrong, the Courts would not permit a person to be harassed although no case for taking cognizance of the offence has been made out336. An act of breach of trust simpliciter involves a civil wrong of which the person wronged may seek his redress for damages in a civil Court but a breach of trust with mens rea gives rise to a criminal prosecution as well. The element of 'dishonest intention' is therefore, an essential element to constitute the offence of Criminal Breach of Trust.337. Breach of trust may be basically a civil wrong, but it gives rise to criminal liability also when there is mens rea.338. The difference between the two lies in dishonest intention.339. If there is a flavour of civil nature, the same cannot be agitated in the form of criminal proceeding. If there is huge delay and in order to avoid the period of limitation, it cannot be resorted to a criminal proceeding.340. A civil suit was filed alleging negligence and breach of contractual obligations. The Court said that a breach of contract simpliciter does not constitute any offence. The criminal complaint must disclose the ingredients of the offence. For ascertaining the prima facie correctness of the allegations the Court can look at the correspondence between the parties and other admitted documents. Criminal proceedings should not be encouraged when they are found to be mala fide or otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court.341. Merely because a civil claim has been raised by the complainant regarding the breach of agreement, it cannot prevent him from initiating criminal proceedings.342. Though a case of breach of trust may be both a civil wrong and a criminal offence but there would be certain situations where it would predominantly be a civil wrong and may or may not amount to a criminal offence. The present case is one of that type where, if at all, the facts may constitute a civil wrong and the ingredients of the criminal offences are wanting. Having regard to the relevant documents including the trust deed as also the correspondence following the creation of the tenancy, the submissions advanced on behalf of the parties, the natural relationship between the settlor and the trustee as mother and son and the fall out in their relationship and the fact that the wife of the co-trustee was no more interested in the tenancy, it must be held that the criminal case should not be continued.343."

This section inflicts enhanced punishment on such a person for criminal breach of trust. The property must have been entrusted to the accused in his capacity as a clerk or a servant. A clerk or a servant who takes his master's property is punishable for theft.\n1. 'Clerk'.—A clerk in modern usage means a writer in an office, public or private, either for keeping accounts or entering minutes.\n2. 'Servant'.—Master and servant—a relation whereby a person calls in the assistance of others, where his own skill and labour are not sufficient to carry out his own business or purpose.358. A servant acts under the direct control and supervision of the master and is bound to conform to all reasonable orders given in the course of his work.359.\n3. 'Employed as a clerk or servant'.—Where the accused employee dishonestly misappropriated money entrusted with him and left the service and there is no documentary evidence except extra-judicial confession of accused Court held that accused is entitled to acquittal.360. Where a person sent his salesman with a letter to fetch Rs. 10,000 from his residence and he, instead of returning, slipped away with the money, it was held that the fact that he absconded for a number of days clearly established his intention of causing wrongful gain for himself.361.\n\nIn the prosecution of an employee under this section, the original account books were destroyed after the matter was decided by the sessions' judge, so that it was impossible for the appellate Court to verify the correctness of the questionable entries and the other evidence was of suspicious nature, the Court had no choice but to acquit the accused.362. The Court relied upon its own earlier decision363. where it was observed: \"The appellate court and the revisional court are entitled, while scrutinising the case against the accused, to have complete material before it on which the prosecution relies for proving the case against the accused persons. In the present case, to deprive this court of the benefit of looking at the entries, in a serious infirmity which must be held fatal to the prosecution case.\"364.\n\n\n\n\n\n358.

As a rule the duties of such persons are of a highly confidential character, involving great powers of control over the property entrusted to them; and a breach of trust by such persons may often induce serious public and private calamity."

    "section409.1": {
      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "In order to sustain conviction under section 409, IPC, 1860, two ingredients are to be proved; namely, (i) the accused, a public servant or a banker or agent was entrusted with the property of which he is duty bound to account for; and (ii) the accused has committed criminal breach of trust. What amounts to criminal breach of trust is provided under section 405, IPC, 1860. The basic requirement to bring home the accusations under section 405 are the requirements to prove conjointly (i) entrustment and (ii) whether the accused was actuated by dishonest intention or not, misappropriated it or converted it to his own use to the detriment of the persons who entrusted it.368.\nMerely because the accused allegedly kept the amount in defiance of the official instruction, it cannot be an incriminating circumstance to arrive at a conclusion that he has committed the breach of trust. It is a settled position of law that suspicion howsoever grave cannot take the place of proof.369.\nThe section cannot be construed as implying that any head of an office that is negligent in seeing that the rules about remitting money to the treasury are observed is ipso facto guilty of criminal breach of trust; but something more than that is required to bring home the dishonest intention. There should be some indication which justifies a finding that the accused definitely had the intention of wrongfully keeping Government out of the moneys.370. Subjecting to a civil liability would thus attract one of the ingredients of criminal breach of trust. There cannot be, however, any doubt whatsoever that a mere error of judgment would not attract the penal provision\n\ncontained in section 409 of the IPC, 1860.371. the fact that the accused puts back the money,372. or promises to do so,373. does not wipe out the offence or absolve him from liability. Where a post-master misappropriated the money entrusted to him but paid back the whole amount before being challenged, his acquittal on this ground was held to be wrong.374. But the Courts do take that fact into account as a mitigating factor and would consider light punishment as sufficient to meet the ends of justice.375. Where certain articles disappeared from an open godown which was being watched by a Chowkidar (watchman), it was held that the over-all incharge overseer could not be held liable under the section unless there was the proof that the articles disappeared because of his doings or non-doings.376.\nThe offence under the section requires criminal intent or mens rea. Where in the matter of post office deposit accounts, all that was proved showed that there was negligence in maintaining them, the Court said that it could be a fit case for departmental proceedings but not proceedings under section 409 because the intention to misappropriate the proceeds of the accounts was not in evidence.377."

It was held that the ingredients of the section were not satisfied.378. The complaint does not contain the averment that Rs.5 lakhs was entrusted to the appellant, either in his personal capacity or as the Chairman of Maharashtra State Electricity Board and that he misappropriated it for his own use. The said amount was deposited by the complainant company with MSEB and there is nothing in the complaint which may even remotely suggest that the complainant had entrusted any property to appellant or that the appellant had dominion over the said money of the complainant, which was converted by him to his own use, so as to satisfy the ingredients of section 405 IPC, 1860.

      "content": "The allegation is that while he was working as a Lower Division Clerk in the Office of the Deputy Superintendent of Police, the accused had temporarily misappropriated an amount of Rs. 1,839. Admittedly, the sum had been deposited in the post office before the due date and that no loss had been caused to the Department, even if it is assumed that a false entry had been made in the record. Offence alleged under IPC, 1860 against the appellant are trivial in nature and have caused no harm and in fact no offences in the eye of law. The benefit of section 95 IPC, 1860 is available to the appellant.383.\n1. 'In his capacity of a public servant'.—Persons like public servants, bankers, etc., who are made liable under the section occupy a position of highly confidential nature involving great power of control over property entrusted to them. Breach of trust by such persons may result in serious public or private calamity. High morality is expected from such persons. They are supposed to discharge their duties honestly.384. Where a police dog handler had taken a sum of money by way of travelling and daily allowance (TA, DA), but went on to his native place on unauthorized absence and returned the money on coming back, it was held that he did not use the money for the official purpose and though the diversion was temporary, it constituted an offence under the section. The trial Court convicted him. It was held that there was no scope for interference in the judgment of the trial Court.385.\n2. 'Banker'.—A banker is one who receives money to be drawn out again as the owner has occasion for it, the customer being lender, and the banker borrower, with the superadded obligation of honouring the customer's cheques up to the amount of the money received and still in the banker's hands.386. The word 'banker' includes a cashier or shroff.387. In ANZ Grindlays Bank plc v Shipping and Clearing (Agents) Pvt Ltd,388. it was held that relation between the bank and its depositors is that of debtor and creditor but that the relation of trust can be created under special circumstances.\n\nWhere the principal debtor did not repay the bank loan, the bank as creditor can adjust it at the maturity of the fixed deposit receipts deposited by the guarantor with the bank as security, though the debt became barred by limitation at the time of maturity of the said fixed deposit receipts. Such adjustment would not amount to offences punishable under sections 109, 114 and 409 IPC, 1860.389. Bank officials who allowed advance credits on banker's cheques to a customer in violation of Departmental instructions acted in violation of direction of law. The officials had dominion over the money belonging to the bank and they dishonestly used that money for conferring a benefit on the customer. They were held guilty of the offence under the section.390."

      "title": "Securities Scam.—",
      "content": "The National Housing Bank cannot advance loans to anybody except housing finance institutions, scheduled banks and statutory slum clearance bodies. The advancement of any loan to any individual is an offence under National Housing Bank Act, 1987. Allegation of advancement of loan to Harshad Mehta by NHB under the disguise of a call money transaction was held illegal. If as result of that illegal transaction a private person who was not expected to reap the fruit of 'call money' was allowed to retain the same for a period to make an unlawful gain therefrom, offence of criminal breach of trust must be held to be have been committed.391.\n3. 'Merchant'.—A merchant is one who traffics to remote countries; also any one dealing in the purchase and sale of goods.392. A failure on the part of persons responsible to refund the share application money when it becomes refundable\n\nbecause of the stock exchange refusal to approve the prospectus, has been taken to be a misappropriation by a merchant.393.\n4. 'Factor'.—Is a substitute in mercantile affairs; an agent employed to sell goods or merchandise consigned or delivered to him by or for his principal, for a compensation commonly called factorage or commission.394. Complainant took loan from company against shares of complainant. Shares were not returned to him after repayment of loan. Court below has found that the charge under section 409 was tenable since, though the accused were not bankers or the public servants, they would fit in the category of factor. The \"factor\" has been defined in Law Lexicon as \"A factor is a mercantile agent who, in the customary course of his business as such agent, is entrusted with the possession or control of goods, wares, or merchandise for sale on commission\". An agent employed to sell goods or merchandise consigned or delivered to him, by or for his principal, for compensation commonly called \"factorage\" or \"commission\". The Bombay High Court held that it cannot be held that accused directors of company were agent, employed by complainant, to sell goods or merchandise, entrusted to them for compensation called a \"factorage\" or \"commission\" and the accused were not covered by definition of 'factor' as envisaged under section 409 IPC, 1860.395.\n5. 'Broker'.—Is an agent employed to make bargains and contracts between other persons in matters of trade, commerce and navigation, by explaining the intentions of both parties, and negotiating in such a manner as to put those who employ him in a condition to treat together personally. More commonly he is an agent employed by one party only to make a binding contract with another.396.\nA factor is entrusted with the possession as well as the disposal of property; a broker is employed to contract about it without being put in possession.397.\n6. 'Attorney'.—Is one who is appointed by another to do something in his absence, and who has authority to act in the place and turn of him by whom he is delegated.398. The High Court, while dismissing the revision petition, observed that it was possible that the appellants were duped by the general power of attorney holder who knew that his powers had been revoked but concealed the fact. If there any bona fides in the conduct of the accused person, (by reason of revival of power), such arguments could have made at the trial stage. The Court refused to interfere in the judgment.399.\n7. 'Agent'.—Is a person employed to do any act for another, or to represent another in dealings with third persons.400. An agent though bound to exercise his authority in accordance with all lawful instructions which may be given to him from time to time by his principal is not subject in its exercise to the direct control or supervision of the principal.401. The trustee of a temple is an agent of the deity, and if he misappropriates temple jewels he is guilty under this section.402. Where it is a servant's duty to account for and pay over the moneys received by him at stated times, his not doing so wilfully amounts to embezzlement.403. The term 'agent' is not restricted to persons who carry on the profession of agents. The requirements of this section would be satisfied if the person is an agent of another and that other person entrusts him with property or with any dominion over property in the course of his duties as an agent. The entrustment must be in connection with his duties as an agent.404. Where the appellant, an agent entrusted with the distribution of the rice under the 'Food for Work Scheme' to the workers on production of coupons was charged with misappropriation of 67.65 quintals of rice, the evidence proves that there was entrustment of property to the accused, Court upheld the conviction.405."

An Assistant Engineer was charged for criminal breach of trust for misappropriating Govt. Funds. It was found that there was no entrustment of funds to the accused public servant. It was held that question of misappropriation of funds does not arise.415. Accordingly, a school inspector withdrawing money against false pay bills and misappropriating the entire amount was held to be punishable for misappropriation and cheating but not of criminal breach of trust because the amount withdrawn was not entrusted to him.416. Where a postal delivery agent was given an insured cover supposed to contain Rs. 1000 and on delivery to the addressee, who opened the cover in the presence of the agent, it was found that it contained blank papers, the agent was held not liable under the section.

Where a quantity of diesel oil which was delivered to a junior officer under his signature and he embezzled it, his senior was not allowed to be prosecuted. There was no entrustment to him.

Thus where the accused, an official of the Indian Unit of Hindustan Insurance Society who had no authority to collect premiums from Pakistani policy- holders, did in fact represent to them that they could pay their premiums to him and also issued receipts purporting to act in his official capacity and thereafter misappropriated the money after making false entries in the relevant register, it was held that he was guilty under section 409, IPC, 1860.424.

      "content": "In 'criminal breach of trust', an accused comes into possession of a property or acquires dominion over a property honestly and bona fide, but he develops dishonest intention subsequent to the taking possession of, or subsequent to having acquired the dominion over, the property and, having developed such dishonest intention, he dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use the property or dishonestly uses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do. Thus, in 'criminal breach of trust', the intention of the accused cannot be dishonest or mala fide at the time, when he comes into possession of the property or comes to acquire dominion over the property; but, having come into possession of, or having acquired dominion over, the property, the accused develops dishonest intention and actuated by such mens rea, he converts to his own use the property or dishonestly uses or disposes of the property in violation of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust, or wilfully suffers any other person so to do. Contrary to what happens in \"criminal breach of trust\", the intention of the accused, in a case or \"cheating\", is dishonest from the very commencement of the transaction. There is really no consent by the person, who is intentionally induced by deception to deliver the property or allow any person to retain the property or is intentionally induced, as a result of deception, to do or omit to do anything, which he would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived, and which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property. In short, thus, while in \"criminal breach of trust\", the accused comes into possession of the property without dishonest intention and develops dishonest intention subsequent to his coming into possession of the property, the offence of 'cheating' is one, wherein the accused has dishonest intention from the very commencement of the transaction.426."

As observed earlier, there is no specific allegation made against any person but the members of the board and senior executives are joined as the persons looking after the management and business of the appellant Company.430. The Penal Code does not contain any provision for attaching vicarious liability on the part of the Managing Director or the Directors of the Company when the accused is the Company. The learned Magistrate failed to pose unto himself the correct question, viz., as to whether the complaint petition, even if given face value and taken to be correct in its entirety, would lead to the conclusion that the respondents herein were personally liable for any offence. The Bank is a body corporate. Vicarious liability of the Managing Director and Director would arise provided any provision exists in that behalf in the Statute. Statutes indisputably must contain provision fixing such vicarious liabilities. Even for the said purpose, it is obligatory on the part of the complainant to make requisite allegations which would attract the provisions constituting vicarious liability.431. In the case of Punjab National Bank v Surendra Prasad Sinha,432. a complaint was lodged by the complainant for prosecution under sections 409, 109 and 114, IPC, 1860 against the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank and a host of officers Since the principal debtor defaulted in payment of debt, the Branch Manager of the bank on maturity of the said fixed deposit adjusted a part of the amount against the said loan. The complainant alleged that the debt became barred by limitation and, therefore, the liability of the guarantors also stood extinguished. It was, therefore, alleged that the officers of the bank criminally embezzled the said amount with dishonest intention to save themselves from financial obligation. The Magistrate without adverting whether the allegations in the complaint prima facie make out an offence charged for, in a mechanical manner, issued the process against all the accused persons. The High Court refused to quash the complaint and the matter finally came to Supreme Court. The Supreme Court allowed the appeal, quashed the proceedings and held that the complaint was laid impleading the Chairman, the Managing Director of the Bank by name and a host of officers. There lies responsibility and duty on the Magistracy to find whether the concerned accused should be legally responsible for the offence charged for. Only on satisfying that the law casts liability or creates offence against the juristic person or the persons impleaded then only process would be issued."

Act No. 28 of 1993, section 2.\nSection 411 of the principal Act shall be renumbered as sub-section (1) of that section and after sub-section (1) as so renumbered, the following sub-section shall be added, namely—\n\"(2) Whoever dishonestly receives or retains any idol or icon stolen from any building used as a place of worship knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen property shall, notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (1), be punished with rigorous imprisonment which shall not be less than two years but which may exceed to three years and with fine which shall not be less than two thousand rupees:\nProvided that the court may, for adequate and special reasons to be mentioned in the judgment, impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than two years.\"\n\n\n\n(a) Dishonest receipt or retention of stolen property. (b) Knowledge or reason to believe at the time of receipt that the property was obtained in the ways specified in the section. The offence of dishonest retention of property is almost contemporaneous with the offence of dishonestly receiving stolen property. A person who dishonestly receives property and retains it, must obviously continue to retain it. It is the duty of the prosecution in order to bring home the guilt of a person under section 411 to prove:\n\n(1) That the stolen property was in the possession of the accused.\n(2) That some person other than the accused had possession of the property before the accused got possession of it and\n(3) That the accused had knowledge that the property was stolen.445. When the field from which the ornaments were recovered was an open one, and accessible to all and sundry, it is difficult to hold positively that the accused was is possession of these articles. The fact of recovery by the accused is compatible with the circumstance of somebody else having placed the articles there and of the accused somehow acquiring knowledge about their whereabouts and that being so, the fact of discovery cannot be regarded as conclusive proof that the accused was in possession of these articles.446.\n\nAs observed by the Apex Court in the case of N Madhavan v State of Kerala,447. as a normal rule after an inquiry or trial when the accused is discharged or acquitted the Court ought to restore the property from the person from whose custody it was taken and in a case of conviction, it is the person from whose possession it was stolen, who would be entitled to its possession when the property seized is referable to such stolen property.\n1. 'Dishonestly receives or retains'.— To constitute dishonest retention, there must have been a change in the mental element of possession,—possession always subsisting animo et facto—from an honest to a dishonest condition of the mind in relation to the thing possessed. Where pursuant to a hire purchase agreement, on the default of the purchaser to pay the instalment amount, the seller of a vehicle repossessed it, it was held that as there was no dishonest intention to retain on his part, the provisions of this section were not attracted.448."

'Knowing or having reason to believe the same to be stolen property'.—The offence made punishable is not the receiving of stolen property from any particular person, but receiving such property knowing it to be stolen. The word 'believe' is a much stronger word than suspect, and it involves the necessity of showing that the circumstances were such that a reasonable man must have felt convinced in his mind that the property with which he was dealing must be stolen property.450."

It varies according to whether the property in question in its nature is capable of passing readily from hand to hand. If the goods are not of that kind, even one year may not be too long.

It refers to persons other than actual dacoits. It provides the same punishment to a receiver of property obtained in dacoity as to dacoits themselves. It is apparent from a plain reading of section 412 IPC, 1860, that a person receiving stolen goods, would be guilty of the offence under section 412 IPC, 1860, if it can further be shown, that the recipient of the goods knew (or had reason to believe), that the person offering the goods, belonged to a gang of dacoits.458."

Where properties looted in a dacoity were found in the possession of the accused who was the resident of the neighbouring village within three days of the occurrence, it was held that it could be presumed that he had known or had reason to believe that the properties were the stolen properties of the dacoity and as such his conviction under section 412, IPC, 1860, was quite in order.460. The same principle was upheld by the Supreme Court to say that where property looted in a dacoity was recovered from the accused very soon after the dacoity, the accused could not be convicted under section 395 but his conviction under section 412, IPC, 1860, would be quite in order.461.

A, knowing that in consequence of such sale he has no right to the property, sells or mortgages the same to Z, without disclosing the fact of the previous sale and conveyance to B, and receives the purchase or mortgage money from Z. A cheats.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nIn most of the foregoing offences relating to property the offender merely got possession of the thing in question, but in the case of cheating he obtains possession plus property in it.\nThe authors of the Code observe: \"We propose to make it cheating to obtain property by deception in all cases where the property is fraudulently obtained; that is to say, in all cases where the intention of the person who has by deceit obtained the property was to cause a distribution of property which the law pronounces to be a wrongful distribution, and in no other case whatever. However immoral a deception may be, we do not consider it as an offence against the rights of property if its object is only to cause a distribution of property which the law recognizes as rightful.\n\"We propose to punish as guilty of cheating a man who, by false representations, obtains a loan of money, not meaning to repay it; a man who, by false representations, obtains an advance of money, not meaning to perform the service or to deliver the article for which the advance is given; a man who, by falsely pretending to have performed work for which he was hired, obtains pay to which he is not entitled.\n\"In all these cases there is deception. In all, the deceiver's object is fraudulent. He intends in all these cases to acquire or retain wrongful possession of that to which some other person has a better claim and which that other person is entitled to recover by law. In all these cases, therefore, the object has been wrongful gain, attended with wrongful loss. In all, therefore, there has, according to our definition, been cheating\".472."

The second class of acts set-forth in the section is the doing or omitting to do anything which the person deceived would not do or omit to do if he were not so deceived. In the first class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest. In the second class of acts, the inducing must be intentional but not fraudulent or dishonest.474.\nIn the definition of cheating there are set forth two separate classes of acts which the person deceived may be induced to do.

In the first class of cases the inducing must be fraudulent or dishonest.

For cases in which property is transferred a more specific provision is made by section 420.\nThe offence of cheating is not committed if a third party, on whom no deception has been practised, sustains pecuniary loss in consequence of the accused's act.475."

      "title": "Breach of contract and cheating.—",
      "content": "The distinction between mere breach of contract and the offence of cheating is a fine one. It depends upon the intention of the accused at the time of inducement which may be judged by his subsequent conduct, but for which the subsequent conduct is not the sole test. Mere breach of contract cannot give rise to criminal prosecution under section 420, IPC, 1860, unless fraudulent or dishonest intention is shown right at the beginning of the transaction, which is the time when the offence is said to have been committed.477. There was allegation from one side that no payment was being made under the contract. The other side pleaded that part payments were made from time to time and the balance was withheld due to non-standard nature of the work and a letter to that effect was issued. The Court said that the controversy was wholly of civil nature. There was total absence of dishonest criminal intention to dupe contractions' right from the inception of the relationship.478. Although breach of contract per se would not come in the way of initiation of a criminal proceeding, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that in absence of the averments made in the complaint petition wherefrom the ingredients of an offence can be found out, the Court should not hesitate to exercise its jurisdiction under section 482 of the Cr PC, 1973.479.\n\nThe distinction was explained by the Supreme Court in a case involving an agreement for sale of property. The allegation in the complaint was that the seller had not disclosed that one of his brothers had filed a partition suit which was pending. There\n\nwas no allegation that non-disclosure of the suit was intentional. The dishonest intention on the part of the accused at the beginning of negotiations was not made out by averments in the complaint. The High Court was wrong in declining to quash the criminal proceedings.480.\nThe accused promised, propagated and induced the public through advertisements to invest money in a circulation scheme. Double the money was promised to a member who enrolled 14 new members. The scheme was found to be practically impossible. Thus there was an element of cheating.481."

    "section415.5": {
      "title": "Cheating, criminal breach of trust, and criminal misappropriation.—",
      "content": "Cheating differs from the last two offences in the fact that the cheat takes possession of property by deception. There is wrongful gain or loss in both cases and in both cases there is inducement to deliver property. In the case of cheating the dishonest intention starts with the very inception of the transaction. But in the case of criminal breach of trust, the person who comes into possession of but retains it or converts it to his own use against the terms of the contract.483.\nCriminal breach of trust and cheating are two distinct offences generally involving dishonest intention but mutually exclusive and different in basic concept. The former is voluntary but the latter is purely on the basis of inducement with dishonest intention.484.\n1. 'Deceiving any person'.—Deceiving means causing to believe what is false, or misleading as to a matter of fact, or leading into error. Whenever a person fraudulently represents as an existing fact that which is not an existing fact, he commits this offence. A wilful misrepresentation of a definite fact with intent to defraud, cognizable by the senses—as where a seller represents the quantity of coal to be 14 cwt. whereas it is in fact only eight cwt. but so packed as to look more; or where the seller, by manoeuvring, contrives to pass off tasters of cheese as if extracted from the cheese offered for sale, whereas it is not—is a cheating.485. Deception is a necessary ingredient for the offences of cheating under both parts of this section. The complainant, therefore, necessarily needs to prove that the inducement had been caused by the deception exercised by the accused. Such deception must necessarily produce the inducement to part with or deliver property, which the complainant would not have parted with or delivered, but for the inducement resulting from deception. The explanation to the section would clearly indicate that there must be no dishonest concealment of facts. In other words, non-disclosure of relevant information would also be treated as a misrepresentation of facts leading to deception.486.\nIt is not sufficient to prove that a false representation had been made but it is further necessary to prove that the representation was false to the knowledge of the accused and was made in order to deceive the complainant.487. Where a party was persuaded\n\nto take out a policy of insurance and the insurer subsequently failed to pay on the happening of the event insured against, it was held that a dishonest intention cannot be inferred from a subsequent failure to fulfil a promise.488.\nIt is not necessary that the false pretence should be made in express words; it can be inferred from all the circumstances attending the obtaining of the property,489. or from conduct.490. If a person orders out goods on credit promising to pay for them on a particular day knowing that it was impossible for him to pay, this would amount to cheating. But the mere fact that he is in embarrassed circumstances does not lead to such inference.491."
    },
    "section415.6": {
      "title": "Cheque discounting facility.—",
      "content": "The complainant is required to show that accused had fraudulent or dishonest intention at the time of making promise or representation. In the absence of culpable intention at the time of making initial promise, no offence is made out under section\n420. In present case, the allowing of cheque discounting facility by bank officials to customers of the bank, without any criminal intent being proved, did not amount to commission of offence, particularly as facility allowed was not contrary to RBI Guidelines. It could not also be said that there was a meeting of minds in a conspiracy to commit an offence, nor an act of corruption could be inferred from transactions between the bank and its customers. The accused officials might have been prosecuted under section 409 but they were not so charged. Their conviction was set aside.492.\n2. 'Fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived to deliver any property'.—The words 'fraudulently' and 'dishonestly' do not govern the whole of the definition of cheating. The section is divided into two parts, the second of which provides for the case of a person who, by deceiving another intentionally, induces the person so deceived to do an act which causes or is likely to cause damage or harm although the deceiver has not acted fraudulently or dishonestly.493.\n3. 'Or to consent that any person shall retain any property'.—It is cheating whether a deception causes a person fraudulently or dishonestly to acquire property by delivery, or to retain property already in his possession.\nProperty does not have to be a thing which has money or market value. Since a passport is a tangible thing and a document of great importance for travel abroad there can be no doubt that it is property within the meaning of this section. Thus where the accused obtained several passports by making false representation to the passport issuing authority they were rightly convicted under sections 420 and 420/120B, IPC, 1860.494.\n4. 'Intentionally inducing that person to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit, etc.'.—Intention is the gist of the offence. The person cheated must have been intentionally induced to do an act which he would not have done or to omit to do an act which he would have done, owing to the deception practised on him. The intention at the time of the offence and the consequence of the act or omission itself has to be considered.495. Intent refers to the dominant motive of action, and not to a casual or merely possible result.496. Where the facts narrated in the complaint revealed a commercial transaction, it was held that such a transaction could not lead to the conclusion of a criminal intention to cheat. The Court said that the crux of this offence is the intention of the accused person.497.\n\nSections 415 read with section 420 indicates that fraudulent or dishonest inducement on the part of the accused must be at the inception and not at a subsequent stage. In this case, blank cheques were handed over to the accused during the period 2000– 2004 for use of business purposes but the dispute between the parties admittedly arose much after that, i.e., in 2005. Thus, no case for proceeding against the respondent under section 420 is made out. Filling up of the blanks in a cheque by itself would not amount to forgery. A case for proceeding against the respondents under section 406 IPC, 1860 has been made out. A cheque being a property, the same was entrusted to the respondents. If the property has been misappropriated has been used for a purpose for which the same had been handed over, a case under section 406 IPC, 1860 may be found to have been made out. It may be true that even in a proceeding under section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, the appellant could raise a defence that the cheques were not meant to be used towards discharge of a lawful liability or a debt, but the same by itself would not mean that in an appropriate case, a complaint petition cannot be allowed to be filed.498.\nThe existence of fraudulent intention at the time of making promise or misrepresentation is a necessary ingredient. The mere failure on the part of the accused to keep up the promise is not sufficient to prove the existence of such intention from the beginning.499."

But the latter company terminated the agreement. The bottling company filed a complaint for cheating saying that they had spent a huge amount in setting up their bottling unit. The complaint was quashed. There was no arrangement with the beverages company at the time when the complainant was bringing up his unit, nor did the beverages company have any intention of cheating from the start or at any subsequent stage.501.\nAlthough it is necessary that there should be misrepresentation from the very beginning, the intention to cheat may in some cases develop at a later stage in the process of formation of the contract. The respondent in this case was a co-sharer in the joint property. The other co-sharers sold it to others representing that they had one- third share in the property when in fact it was not so. It was held that no cheating was practiced in the transaction upon the complaining co-sharer. It was a fraud on others. The complainant could not launch a criminal prosecution against them.502.\nThe illustration (b) provided in section 415, IPC, 1860, very well covers the facts of this case for cheating by the accused. The illustration provides that \"(b) A, by putting a counterfoil mark on an article, intentionally deceives Z into a belief that this article was made in a certain celebrated manufacturer, and thus dishonestly induces Z to buy and pay for the article, A cheats.\"503."

Therefore, the non-disclosure of the previous encumbrances will not affect the rights of the previous mortgagees and will not pass a complete title to the purchaser; the purchaser may nevertheless have been cheated.507. Where the vendor of immovable property omitted to mention that there was an encumbranceon the property, it was held that he could not be convicted of cheating unless it was shown either that he was asked by the vendee whether the property was encumbered and said it was not, or that he sold the property on the representation that it was unencumbered.508."

'Which act or omission causes or is likely to cause damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation or property'.—The damage must be the direct, natural or probable consequence of the induced act. The resulting damage or likelihood of damage may not be within the actual contemplation of the accused when the deceit was practised. The person deceived must have acted under the influence of deceit, and the damage must not be too remote.510. The use of the expression \"cause\" in this section postulates a direct and proximate casual connection between the act or omission and the harm and damage to the victim.511.\nIt is necessary that the harm should be caused to the person deceived.

If the appellants' plea is accepted then for the offence under section 417 IPC, 1860, which is an offence of minor nature, a company could be prosecuted and punished with fine whereas for the offence under section 420, which is an aggravated form of cheating by which the victim is dishonestly induced to deliver property, the company cannot be prosecuted as there is a mandatory sentence of imprisonment. There is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the punishment prescribed is mandatory imprisonment.518. A corporation is virtually in the same position as any individual and may be convicted of common law as well as statutory offences including those requiring mens rea. The criminal liability of a corporation would arise when an offence is committed in relation to the business of the corporation by a person or body of persons in control of its affairs. Companies and corporate houses can no longer claim immunity from criminal prosecution on ground that they are incapable of possessing necessary mens rea.519. Since, the majority of the Constitution Bench ruled in Standard Chartered Bank v Directorate of Enforcement,520. that the company can be prosecuted even in a case where the Court can impose substantive sentence as also fine, and in such case only fine can be imposed on the corporate body.521."

Thus where the accused dishonestly induced the complainant and his daughter to go through the marriage ceremony professing himself to be a bachelor while he had a wife living, it was held that his act amounted to an offence both under sections 416 and 417, IPC, 1860, as harm was caused to the complainant and his daughter to their body, mind, reputation and even to their property.535.

Where there is delivery of any property or destruction of any valuable security, section 420 is the proper section to apply.536. The accused made false representation to the complainant by way of promise to marry her and believing such promise she complied with his request by sharing the bed together. Consequently she became pregnant but he refused to marry her. The accused challenged the proceedings initiated against him under section 417. It was held that prima facie case was made out under the section.537.\n\nCertain letters were prepared on the letterhead of a Minister by the accused by which actors were invited to a cultural show. Letters did not carry the signature of the Minister. The Court said that the act of the accused did not cause nor was likely to cause any harm to any person in mind or body. His conviction under section 417 was held to be not proper.538. Only because accused issued cheques which were dishonoured, the same by itself would not mean that he had cheated the complainant. Assuming that such a statement had been made, the same, does not exhibit that there had been any intention on the part of the appellant herein to commit an offence under section 417 of the Penal Code.539. Where accused giving assurance of marriage to victim girl had undergone intercourse with victim and she would not have undergone intercourse had there been no such assurance of marriage by accused. Accused subsequently having disowned assurance given by him. It was held that ingredients of cheating under section 415 can be said to have been established. Accused held guilty of committing offence punishable under section 417 of Code.540. Where accused is liable to be convicted under section 376 on allegation sexual intercourse by false promise of marriage there cannot be any separate conviction under section 417.541. Though once the accused-appellant alleged failed to keep his promise she allowed him to commit sexual intercourse for the second time and invited her pregnancy. Not only that, even after termination of pregnancy for the second time she again allowed the accused-appellant to have sexual intercourse with her and make her pregnant for the third time. Offence under section 417 not made out.542. Accused allegedly committed sexual intercourse on prosecutrix on pretext that he would provide temporary job of peon to her in bank which would be regularized after completion of one year. Though the offence under section 376 is not made out, offence under section 417 is made out.543. Where accused wanted to marry prosecutrix and on her refusal committed forcible sexual intercourse with her. But, if the promise of marriage was given and the girl had succumbed on that account, by itself, may not amount to cheating. Besides\n\n\n\n\n\n536. No process was issued where the allegations were that the girl was represented to be as hale and hearty and it was found after the marriage that she was weak of sight and had urinary infection.

But where there is delivery or destruction of any property or alteration or destruction of any valuable security resulting from the act of the person deceiving this section comes into operation. For an offence under this section it must be proved that the complainant parted with his property acting on a representation which was false to the knowledge of the accused and that the accused had a dishonest intention from the outset.549. In Sonbhandra Coke Products v State of UP,550. it was held that offence of cheating can be made out only if it has been shown that damage or harm has been caused to the person so deceived.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the word 'property' in this section does not necessarily mean that the thing, of which a delivery is dishonestly desired by the person who cheats, must have a money value or a market value, in the hand of the person cheated. The communicated order of assessment received by an assessee is \"property\".551.\nAn admission card to sit for an Examination of a University is property within the meaning of this section; though the admission card as such has no pecuniary value it has immense value to the candidate for the examination.552.A driving licence or its duplicate553. had been held to be property within the meaning of this section. Where a bank was defrauded of a large amount and the signatures of the accused bank manager on drafts used for the purpose were proved beyond doubt to be his signature, his conviction under the section was held to be proper.554. Where a builder was defrauded by a conspiring team of financiers by giving him counterfeit currency, conviction under this section was fully warranted.555. In the ordinary course of things, relationship of banker and customer is that of debtor and creditor and not that of trustee and beneficiary. Payment of money against cheques already issued by the customer at a time when the bank had received notice to close the account did not in itself amount to cheating the customer in conspiracy with the payee.556."

The intention to deceive should be in existence at the time when the inducement was made. Mere failure to keep up a promise subsequently cannot be presumed as leading to cheating.558.\nThe intention to deceive was held to be not there either at the initial stage or any subsequent stage in the mere fact of transferring a portion of the property over which the transferors had no complete ownership. The sale could be binding only to the extent of the transferor's right.559. Where bogus receipts were issued for part payment of the price of the property over which the recipient had no ownership and therefore, no right to sell, he was held to be guilty of the offence under the section.560."

Issuing a cheque without arrangement of sufficient funds may amount to cheating.561. Where goods were delivered in a normal sales transaction and the buyer had also become the owner of the goods because the transfer of ownership was not linked with payment, it was held that the fact that a cheque for the price, which was issued in due course, bounced, did not constitute the offence of cheating because there was no evidence of intention to cheat at the outset of the transaction.562. Dishonest intention cannot be inferred from the bouncing of a cheque issued for an existing debt. The conviction of the accused for return of such cheque was not proper.563.\nA cheque was handed over in a share transaction by the accused. The cheque was signed by his wife. The person who passed the cheque was held guilty of cheating because of the dishonour but not his wife because she was not seen anywhere near the transaction.564."

Dishonest concealment was also included within \"material facts\".

      "content": "It may be true that where the Court finds that the dispute between the parties was purely of civil nature, it may not allow criminal proceedings to go on. But no such law can be laid down because a case may be such that both a civil action and criminal complaint may be maintainable, the cause of action for both being the same.580. Mere breach of contract does not necessarily involve cheating.581. Where the dispute is\n\nessentially about the profit of the hotel business and its ownership, it is purely civil in nature and hence, the proceedings are quashed.582. Where, complaint is about the non- payment after placing orders for fabrication work on complainant, the complaint would only reveal that the allegations as contained in the complaint are of civil nature and do not prima facie disclose commission of alleged criminal offence under section 420 IPC, 1860. Proceedings quashed.583. Allegation was that appellant had executed a sale deed in his favour in respect of a plot of land which had already been the subject matter of a previous transfer, Court held that he can at best question such transfer and claim damages in respect thereof from the vendor of the appellant by way of appropriate damages, but an action in the Criminal Court would not lie in the absence of any intention to cheat and/or defraud.584. An agreement for sale of land and the earnest money paid to the owner as part consideration and possession of the land having been transferred to the purchasers/complainants and the subsequent unwillingness of the owner to complete the same, gave rise to a liability of a civil nature and the criminal complaint was, therefore, not competent.585."

It contemplates such a concealment or removal of property from the place in which it is deposited, as can be considered fraudulent. Where one of the several partners removed the partnership books at night, and when questioned denied having done so;598. where a judgment-debtor, whose standing crops were attached, harvested them while the attachment was in force;599. where the accused who was bound under the conditions of his tenure to share the produce of his land with the landholder in a certain proportion, dishonestly concealed and removed the produce, thus preventing the landholder from taking his due share,600. it was held that this offence was committed. But a removal of crops to avoid an illegal restraint,601. or removal of property, which was attached after the date fixed for the return of the warrant of attachment, from the possession of the custodian602. was held not to amount to an offence under this section. Certain crops were attached in execution of a decree and placed in the custody of a bailiff. The crops did not belong to the judgment-debtors, and the owners cut and removed a portion of them in spite of the resistance of the bailiff. It was held that no offence was committed.603. In order to bring the case within section 424, IPC, 1860 it is necessary to show that there has been dishonest or fraudulent concealment or removal of any property or dishonest or fraudulent assistance in the matter of concealment or removal of the property. The other part of section 424 is not applicable and therefore, it is not adverted to. There is no case in the complaint that any furniture or equipment have been concealed or removed. The facts averred do not indicate any such removal or concealment. What is stated is that they are still there, but that the complainant is being obstructed from exercising the rights of joint possession over them. The question of assisting in the dishonest or fraudulent removal arises only if there is concealment. Therefore, section 424, IPC, 1860 is not applicable.604.\n\n598.

      "title": "Punishment for mischief.",
      "content": "Whoever commits mischief shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three months, or with fine, or with both.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nIngredients.—This section requires three things:—\n\n(1) intention or knowledge of likelihood to cause wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person;\n(2) causing the destruction of some property or any change in it or in its situation; and\n(3) such change must destroy or diminish its value or utility, or affect it injuriously.\n\nThis section deals with a physical injury from a physical cause.607. Section 426, IPC, 1860 deals with punishment for the offence of \"mischief\" as defined in section 425. The said section 425 enacts a rule of which the maxim sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedasis but a partial exponent. It enacts a rule which, while preserving to the owner the maximum rights of property, prevents his using it to the injury or damage of another and all fortiori it punishes all who wantonly cause such injury or damage to another's property. Neither malice nor an intention to cause injury is essential for the constitution of the offence which may be committed by injury caused with only the knowledge of likelihood, which must, however, he strictly proved. The first part of the section sets out the mens rea on the guilty mind, which is the intention or the knowledge of likelihood of causing wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person. The second part of the section pertains to the actus res, that is to say, the criminal act, which consists in causing destruction to any property or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility or affects it injuriously. The express mention of \"damage\" in the section is indicative of the fact that the purview of the offence of \"mischief\" is not intended to be confined only to cases of \"wrongful loss\", but also to engulf within it all such cases of damages by unlawful means. Destruction of any property within the meaning of the section carries with it the implication that something should be done to the property contrary to its natural use and serviceableness. Mischief implies the causing of wrongful loss or damage and no loss or damage is wrongful unless it involves invasion of a legal right. In any other case it is damnum sine injuria.608.\nActs done or attempted to be done in bona fide assertion of a right, however ill-founded in law that right may be, cannot amount to the offence of mischief within section 425.609. Thus, where the accused pulled down a wall which obstructed his pathway to\n\nhis kotha and which pathway he had been using for the last 22 years, it was held no offence under section 425, IPC, 1860, was committed.610.\n1. 'Intend to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person'.—This section does not necessarily contemplate damage of a destructive character. It requires merely that there should be an invasion of right and diminution of the value of one's property, caused by that invasion of right, which must have been contemplated by the doer of it when he did it.611. A dominant owner, having a right of way over land belonging to another, has no right himself to remove an obstruction unless his right of way is impaired by it. If he does so, he has employed unlawful means and if loss of property is caused thereby to another, he is guilty under this section.612. It is no answer to a charge of mischief to plead that the motive of the accused was to benefit himself, and not to injure another, if he knew that he could only secure that benefit by causing wrongful loss to another.613. Where while taking possession of the allotted portion of a house on the basis of a valid allotment order, the goods were simply put outside the premises and no obstruction was caused to the complainant landlord to collect his goods, offences under sections 425 and 427 were not made out.614.\n2. 'Causes the destruction of any property or any such change in any property, etc.'.—It is the essence of this offence that the perpetrator must cause the destruction of property or such change in it as destroys or diminishes its value or utility. The destruction of a document evidencing an agreement void for immorality constitutes this offence as it can be used as evidence for other collateral purposes.615. The accused on receiving delivery of a registered article from a Postmaster was requested to sign an acknowledgement for the article received by him, but instead of returning the same duly signed he tore it up and threw it on the ground. It was held that he was guilty of mischief.616.\n\nThe 'destruction' or 'change' should be contrary to the natural use and serviceableness of the property in question. If a person unauthorisedly allows goats to graze in a forest, the grazing rights in which are restricted to holders of permits, the offence of mischief is not committed as by such an act the grass is only put to its normal use.617. The accused had a dispute about the possession of a certain land with the complainant. The complainant dug a well with a view to cultivate the said land, but the accused forcibly entered on the land and damaged the well. It was held that accused were guilty of mischief even though the complainant was a trespasser.618. Merely disconnecting electric supply does not amount to destruction of property or to such a change in property as destroys or diminishes its utility or value, and does not constitute an offence of mischief.619. A contrary view to this view of the Calcutta High Court has been taken by the Delhi High Court to say that switching off the electric supply by the landlord to the tenanted premises, even without causing damage to the distribution board or wires supplying electric current diminishes the value and utility of the tenanted premises within the meaning of section 425, IPC, 1860.620. In order to make out an offence of mischief it is necessary to show that there was wrongful loss or damage to the property. So unless the property was destroyed or underwent such a change due to the action of the accused that its utility or value was diminished, no offence under section 425, IPC, 1860, could be said to have been committed. Thus where a family took shelter in the door-way of an uninhabitable and dilapidated house by throwing away a few articles, the offence of mischief was not committed.621. Cutting off the water supply constitutes such destructive change in the flat as diminishes its value or utility.622."

Where a person owns land on which there is a drain, the water running through which is used as of right by way of easement by another person, the former is not guilty of mischief, if the drain is destroyed by him because an easement does not come within the purview of 'property' within the meaning of section 425.624.

There is a contrary view to this which holds that cutting off the water supply does constitute an offence of mischief.628. So also would be the case in regard to cutting off the supply of electricity by the landlord to the tenanted portion of the house.629. This latter view appears to be more reasonable.\n3.

This section is applicable where permanent injury is caused to the animal by the offence of mischief.637. It has been held by the Supreme Court that the offence created by this section and the one under section 9(1) read with section 50 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972 are substantially the same offence. Therefore, the bar of double jeopardy will not operate.638. It is apparent that the most significant words are the opening words of the section which says, \"whoever commits mischief by killing...\" and thus 'mischief' appears to be an essential ingredient for attracting the offence and the mischief has been defined under section 425 of the IPC, 1860. For constituting offence of mischief the essential ingredient would be the destruction of the property. Therefore, if no one has any property or right in any animal, the killing of that animal does not come within the purview of section 425 of the Code and thus, in the facts and circumstances of the instant case where the complainant has never come with the case that any dog over which somebody has right, has been caught, rather according to complaint, only stray dogs have been caught that too where it has never been alleged to have been poisoned, maimed or rendered useless there would be no application of section 429 of the IPC, 1860.639."

The word 'property' used in this section really means some intangible property capable of being destroyed or damaged in its value or utility. It must be remembered that section 440 read with section 44, IPC, 1860 is an offence committed against the property. Sections 425 and 440 appear in the 17th chapter entitled \"Offences against Property.\" If there is no allegation that mischief was committed through the medium of property as is visualised by section 440 read with section 425, IPC, 1860, it is plain that it cannot be validly said that an offence is constituted.648.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n648.

      "content": "The section requires—\n\n(1) Entry into or upon property in the possession of another.\n(2) If such entry is lawful, then unlawfully remaining upon such property.\n(3) Such entry or unlawful remaining must be with intent—\n(a) to commit an offence; or\n(b) to intimidate, insult, or annoy any person in possession of the property.\n\nThe use of criminal force is not a necessary ingredient.\n\n1. 'Enters into or upon property in the possession of another'.—'Property' in this section means immovable corporeal property, and not incorporeal property such as a right of fishery,651. or a right of ferry.652. A person plying a boat for hire within the prohibited distance from a public ferry cannot be said, with reference to such ferry, to commit criminal trespass.653.\nThe possession must be actual possession of some person other than the alleged trespasser.654. The offence can only be committed against a person who is in actual physical possession of the property in question. If the complainant is not in actual possession of the property this offence cannot be committed.655. But the offence may be committed even when the person in possession of the property is absent provided the entering into or upon the property is done with intent to do any of the acts mentioned in the section. Where a person entered upon a field that had been leased, during the absence of the lessee, and ploughed it, and the lessor came to the spot on hearing of it to prevent the commission of such acts, it was held that that was not enough to exonerate that person from intention to annoy the lessee and that such a person could be convicted of criminal trespass.656. The mere taking of unlawful possession of a house will not amount to either criminal trespass or house-trespass. An unlawful act is not necessarily an offence. The house in question must be in actual possession of the complainant. Mere constructive possession is not sufficient.657.\n2. 'Intent to commit an offence'.—Where in a pen-down peaceful strike the employees of the bank entered the office and occupied their seats and refused to work during office hours and was wholly confined to regular working hours and the only act alleged against them was that they refused to vacate their seats when they were called upon to do so by the superior officers, it was held by the Supreme Court that the conduct of strikers did not amount to criminal trespass.658.\n3. 'Or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession'.— In order to establish that the entry on the property was with intent to annoy, intimidate or insult, it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that causing such annoyance, intimidation or insult was the main aim of the entry; it is not sufficient to show merely that the natural\n\nconsequence of the entry was likely to be annoyance, intimidation or insult and this was known to the accused.659.\nThe word 'intimidate' must be understood in its ordinary sense \"to overawe, to put in fear, by a show of force or threats of violence\". 660.\nThe Supreme Court has held that this section does not require that the intention must be to annoy a person who is actually present at the time of the trespass.661.\n4. 'Having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there'.— The original entry may be lawful, but if the person entering remains on the property with the intent specified in the section he commits trespass. Where a person armed with weapons went on land of which he was the owner when no one else was there at the time and refused to vacate it, when called upon to do so by a person who had no right to the land, it was held that the owner did not remain on the land unlawfully and was not therefore, guilty of the offence of criminal trespass.662."

Bona fide claim of right, however ill-founded, nullifies a case of criminal trespass.664. Where certain hutment dwellers of Bombay were facing demolition for having erected their huts on public footpaths and pavements, the Supreme Court held that no offence under the section was made out. Their act was not voluntary. It was the dictate of their moral right to survive and their state of helplessness. They did not intend to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession and that is the gist of the offence of criminal trespass under section 441.665.

Going by the earlier authorities, the court held that refusal to vacate premises after revocation of licence under which possession was given would not by itself constitute a criminal trespass. The intent to do the acts stated in the amendment must also be proved.670."

      "content": "Section 441, IPC, 1860, as amended by Orissa Act, 22 of 1986, defines criminal trespass, which, when committed in respect of, inter alia, a human dwelling, becomes an offence punishable under section 448, IPC, 1860. Ordinarily, a dispute between the tenant and the landlord regarding vacation of a premise after expiry of the period of tenancy is a civil dispute, unless an offence of criminal trespass can be said to have been committed. Prosecution against the tenant would not lie except the cases covered by the Orissa Amendment. Section 441, IPC, 1860, which has been defined by Orissa Act, 22 of 1986, is quoted hereunder for better appreciation:\n.  Whoever enters into or upon property in possession of another with intent to commit\nan offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property.\nOr having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person or with intent to commit an offence;\nor having lawfully entered into or upon such property, remains there with the intention of taking unauthorised possession or making unauthorised use of such property and fails to withdraw from such property or its possession or use, when called upon to do so by that another person by notice in writing duly served on him, is said to commit criminal trespass.\n\nThe aforesaid section consists of three parts. The first two parts are same and similar to that of the original section of the IPC, 1860. The third part, with which the charge is concerned, says that if the person has lawfully entered into the premises and remains there with intention of (i) taking unauthorised possession or (ii) making unauthorised use of such property or (iii) fails to withdraw from such property or its possession or use when called upon to do so by notice in writing duly served on him, he is said to have committed the offence.671. The rigors of section 441, IPC, 1860 as amended by the Orissa Act, 22 of the 198 shall not be applicable to the following cases:\n\n(i) Statutory tenants whose tenancy is governed by any statute.\n(They are protected by tenancy laws like Public Premises Eviction Act, etc.)\n(ii) Tenant who has entered into possession by virtue of a lease.\n(Rights of such tenant are governed under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and the Specific Relief Act and he acquires a right of possession. After determination of tenancy by notice, he would become \"Tenant holding over\"\"Tenant on sufferance\" or 'Tenant at will\" as the case may be. His possession being juridical, is protected. He can be evicted only in due process of law. The possession of such tenant cannot be equated with that of trespassers.)\n(iii) Person who has entered into possession by virtue of some covenant like, agreement to sell, will etc. and/or put forth a genuine right over the property possessed.\n\n(If a person claims a right of title coupled with possession, till the dispute is adjudicated, his possession cannot be conclusively said to be that of a trespasser and his right to possess would be subject to the result of the suit or legal proceeding.)672.\n\n\n\n\n\n649.

      "content": "Whoever commits criminal trespass by entering into1 or remaining in any building,2 tent or vessel used as a human dwelling or any building used as a place for worship, or as a place for the custody of property, is said to commit \"house-trespass\".\nExplanation.—The introduction of any part of the criminal trespasser's body is entering suﬃcient to constitute house-trespass.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe offence of criminal trespass may be aggravated in several ways. It may be aggravated by the way in which it is committed, and by the end for which it is committed. When criminal trespass is committed in a dwelling house, or any building, tent or vessel used for human dwelling, it becomes, 'house trespass' as defined under section 442 IPC, 1860 and punishable under section 448 IPC, 1860. The offence intended to be committed so as to constitute 'criminal trespass' is any offence. But if such offence intended to be committed is one punishable with imprisonment and the criminal trespass is committed in a dwelling house, then the offence which is made out is not one punishable under section 448 IPC, 1860 but one punishable under section 451 IPC, 1860 which is an aggravated form of house trespass.673.\n1. 'Entering into'.—The introduction of any part of the trespasser's body is entering sufficient to constitute house-trespass.674. The roof being a part of a building, if any one goes on the roof of a building that will be tantamount to \"entering into\" the building within the meaning of that expression in this section.675. Section 441, IPC, 1860 would show that it is only when a person unlawfully remains in a property of another person \"with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence\" that an offence of criminal trespass is committed. While there may be evidence in the present case that the accused/opposite party has unlawfully remained in the property belonging to the petitioner or that of the Mosque Committee to whom the petitioner is said to have donated the property, there is no evidence whatsoever that the accused/opposite party remained there with intent to intimidate, insult or annoy the petitioner or the Mosque Committee or with intent to commit an offence.676.\n\n2. 'Building'.—What is a 'building' must always be a question of degree and circumstances; its ordinary and usual meaning is an enclosure of brick or stone work covered in by a roof.677. The mere surrounding of an open space of ground by a wall or fence of any kind cannot be deemed to convert the open space itself into a building, and trespass thereon does not amount to house-trespass.678.

      "content": "Whoever commits house-trespass having taken precautions to conceal such house- trespass from some person who has a right to exclude or eject the trespasser from the building, tent or vessel which is the subject of the trespass, is said to commit \"lurking house-trespass\".\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe authors of the Code say: \"House-trespass, again, may be aggravated by being committed in a surreptitious or in a violent manner. The former aggravated form of house-trespass we designate as lurking house-trespass; the latter we designate as house-breaking. Again, house-trespass, in every form, may be aggravated by the time at which it is committed. Trespass of this sort has, for obvious reasons, always been considered as a more serious offence when committed by night than when committed by day. Thus, we have four aggravated forms of that sort of criminal trespass which we designate as house-trespass, lurking house-trespass, house-breaking, lurking house- trespass by night, and house-breaking by night\".\n\"These are aggravations arising from the way in which the criminal trespass is committed. But criminal trespass may also be aggravated by the end for which it is committed. It may be committed for a frolic. It may be committed in order to (commit) a murder. It may also often happen that a criminal trespass which is venial, as respects the mode, may be of the greatest enormity as respects the end; and that a criminal trespass committed in the most reprehensible mode may be committed for an end of no great atrocity. Thus, A may commit house-breaking by night for the purpose of playing some idle trick on the inmates of a dwelling. B may commit simple criminal trespass by merely entering another's field for the purpose of murder or gang-robbery. Here A commits trespass in the worst way. B commits trespass with the worst object. In our provisions we have endeavoured to combine the aggravating circumstances in such a way that each may have its due effect in settling the punishment.681. The law is well settled that unless the accused is alleged to have taken some active steps and means to conceal his presence, the allegation that the house-trespass was committed by night and the darkness helped the accused in concealing his presence, does not and cannot justify a charge for the offence of committing lurking house-trespass. But if the house-trespass is a lurking house-trespass\" as defined in section 443, IPC, 1860, because of the offender having taken some active steps to conceal his presence, it becomes automatically lurking house-trespass by night under section 444, IPC, 1860, if it is committed after sunset and before sunrise.682."

There must be an unlawful entry and there must be proof of one or the other of the intentions mentioned in section 441. In this case, the evidence produced clearly established the offence.690. The complainant was allotted a shop by the Rehabilitation Department because of his being a displaced person, but the accused persons did not allow him to enter the shop. Though the accused persons entered the shop lawfully they retained it unlawfully and dishonestly for more than 37 years. They were held to be guilty under this section read with section 34. The complainant died during the revision petition. The accused persons' conviction was maintained but they were released on probation and directed to restore the shop to the complainant's son.691. Allegation was that accused went to house of victim in order to commit offence of rape. Though rape was not committed at house of victim but committed at house of accused but entry of accused into house of victim was with intent to commit offence of rape.

The accused was held to be guilty of the offence under section 450 (lurking house- trespass where he entered the house at mid-night getting easy access because of acquaintance with the family and forcibly raped the victim girl finding her alone in her room. He was punished for rape and lurking house-trespass for committing an offence.704. Accused persons committed house trespass in order to commit an offence punishable with imprisonment. They went to the house of complainant with preparation by holding sticks in their hands for assaulting the complainant. Therefore, all the four accused are liable to be convicted under section 451 of the IPC, 1860.705. Where evidence shows that accused after entering the house unlawfully remained there and had even intimidated and insulted and annoyed the victim when they were called upon to quit the house. Court held that conduct of the accused will clearly come within the latter part of section 441 IPC, 1860 and the same will be punishable under section 451 IPC, 1860.706. There is enough material to show that the appellant had committed house trespass, however, not with intention to commit offence punishable with life imprisonment, hence, in such case section 451 IPC, 1860 would be attracted instead of section 450.707. The accused trespassed into the house of the victim girl who was nearly about ten years of age on the date of occurrence and committed unnatural offence on her. After finding the victim alone in the house the accused committed unnatural offence by putting his penis having carnal intercourse against order of nature. Order of acquittal is reversed by the Supreme Court.708.\n\nIt was alleged that the accused trespassed into the house of the victim when she was all alone in order to commit rape. But there was no evidence of any preparation or attempt to rape. The conviction under section 452 was held to be not proper. Since the trespass was not for any pious purpose because an offence under section 354 (outraging modesty) was likely to be involved, conviction was recorded under section 451.709.

      "title": "House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint.",
      "content": "Whoever commits house-trespass, having made preparation for causing hurt to any person, or for assaulting any person, or for wrongfully restraining any person, or for putting any person in fear of hurt, or of assault, or of wrongful restraint, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nThe Legislature has enacted this section to provide higher punishment where house- trespass is committed in order to cause hurt, or to assault, or to wrongfully restrain any person. For a conviction under this section, it is necessary to prove that the dominant intention of the accused was to cause hurt to or to assault or to wrongfully restrain any person.712. Preparation is the genesis of offence under section 452 of IPC, 1860. In absence of it being proved that any device as a metal rod, crow bar or even a stick was used by the accused due to which it could be described as \"preparation for commission of offence,\" it appears to be impossible to hold that there exists adequate material even to frame the charge for offence under section 452 of IPC, 1860.713. Criminal trespass is committed by the accused when they entered the house of an individual with a view to insult, intimidate or annoy such owner of the house/property. If the accused entered the house of an individual to insult, intimidate or annoy any person other than the owner of the property, it would not constitute criminal trespass. Once the conduct of the accused is not criminal trespass, it would not be house trespass and would not become punishable under section 452 IPC, 1860.714.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n712.

      "title": "All persons jointly concerned in lurking house-trespass or house- breaking by night punishable where death or grievous hurt caused by one of them.",
      "content": "If, at the time of the committing of lurking house-trespass by night or house-breaking by night, any person guilty of such offence shall voluntarily cause or attempt to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, every person jointly concerned in committing such lurking house-trespass by night or house-breaking by night, shall be punished with 729.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT—\n\nBefore holding a person to be guilty of offence under section 460, IPC, 1860, the prosecution must prove:—\n(i) that the accused committed lurking house trespass by night; or house breaking by night;\n(ii) that he caused, or attempted to cause, death or grievous hurt;\n\n(iii) that he did above whilst engaged in committing lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by night. On the aforesaid analysis of section, it is clear that this section applies to those persons who have actually committed lurking house trespass at night and not to those who may have accompanied their associates but did not commit the offence. Indeed, it applies to actual doers, and not the others.730. This section deals with the constructive liability of persons jointly concerned in committing 'lurking house-trespass' or 'house-breaking by night' in the course of which death or grievous hurt to any one is caused. It is immaterial who causes death or grievous hurt. Every person jointly concerned in committing such house-trespass or house-breaking shall be punished in the manner provided in the section. A person who actually commits murder in the course of committing house-breaking will attract the penalty under section 302.731. Every person who is jointly concerned in committing the offence of lurking house trespass by night or house breaking by night is to be punished with life imprisonment where death has been caused or with imprisonment which may extend to ten years where grievous hurt has been caused to any person. This joint liability is based upon the principle of constructive liability. Thus, the person who has actually committed the death or grievous hurt would be liable to be punished under the relevant provisions, i.e., section 302 or section 326, as the case may be, while committing the offence of lurking house trespass by night. It is possible that common intention or object be not the foundation of an offence under section 460 IPC, 1860. Thus, to establish an offence under section 460, it may not be necessary for the prosecution to establish common intention or object. Suffice it will be to establish that they acted\n\njointly and committed the offences stated in section 460 IPC, 1860. The principle of constructive liability is applicable in distinction to contributory liability. The Supreme Court in the case of Abdul Aziz v State of Rajasthan,732. clearly stated that if a person committing housebreaking by night also actually commits murder, he must attract the penalty for the latter offence under section 302 and the Court found it almost impossible to hold that he can escape the punishment provided for murder merely because the murder was committed by him while he was committing the offence of housebreaking and that he can only be dealt with under section 460.733.\n\nThe words \"at the time of the committing of\" are limited to the time during which the criminal trespass continues which forms an element in house-trespass, which is itself essential to house-breaking, and cannot be extended so as to include any prior or subsequent time.734. If the offender causes grievous hurt while running away, he will not be punishable under this section.735."

A has committed forgery.\n\n(i) Z dictates his will to A. A intentionally writes down a different legatee from the legatee named by Z, and by representing to Z that he has prepared the will according to his instructions, induces Z to sign the will. A has committed forgery.\n\n(j) A writes a letter and signs it with B's name without B's authority, certifying that A is a man of good character and in distressed circumstances from unforeseen misfortune, intending by means of such letter to obtain alms from Z and other persons. Here, as A made a false document in order to induce Z to part with property. A has committed forgery.\n\n(k) A without B's authority writes a letter and signs it in B's name certifying to A's character, intending thereby to obtain employment under Z. A has committed forgery in as much as he intended to deceive Z by the forged certificate, and thereby to induce Z to enter into an express or implied contract for service.\nExplanation 1.—A man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery.\n\nILLUSTRATIONS\n\n(a) A signs his own name to a bill of exchange, intending that it may be believed that the bill was drawn by another person of the same name. A has committed forgery.\n\n(b) A writes the word \"accepted\" on a piece of paper and signs it with Z's name, in order that B may afterwards write on the paper a bill of exchange drawn by B upon Z, and negotiate the bill as though it had been accepted by Z. A is guilty of forgery; and if B, knowing the fact, draws the bill upon the paper pursuant to A's intention, B is also guilty of forgery.\n\n(c) A picks up a bill of exchange payable to the order of a different person of the same name. A endorses the bill in his own name, intending to cause it to be believed that it was endorsed by the person whose order it was payable; here A has committed forgery.\n\n(d) A purchases an estate sold under execution of a decree against B. B, after the seizure of the estate, in collusion with Z, executes a lease of the estate of Z at a nominal rent and for a long period, and dates the lease six months prior to the seizure, with intent to defraud A, and to cause it to be believed that the lease was granted before the seizure. B, though he executes the lease in his own name, commits forgery by antedating it.\n\n(e) A, a trader, in anticipation of insolvency, lodges effects with B for A's benefit, and with intent to defraud his creditors; and in order to give a colour to the transaction, writes a promissory note binding himself to pay to B a sum for value received, and antedates the note, intending that it may be believed to have been made before. A was on the point of insolvency. A has committed forgery under the first head of the definition.\nExplanation 2.—The making of a false document in the name of a fictitious person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person, intending it to be believed that the document was made by the person in his lifetime, may amount to forgery.\n10.[Explanation 3.—For the purposes of this section, the expression \"aﬃxing 11. [electronic signature]\" shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (d) of subsection (1) of section 2 of the Information Technology Act, 2000].\nILLUSTRATION\n\nA draws a bill of exchange upon a fictitious person, and fraudulently accepts the bill in the name of such fictitious person with intent to negotiate it. A commits forgery.\n\n\n\nC. The third is where a person dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, execute or alter a document knowing that such person could not by reason of (a) unsoundness of mind, or (b) intoxication, or (c) deception practised upon him, know the contents of the document or the nature of the alteration. In short, a person is said to have made a 'false document', if (i) he made or executed a document claiming to be someone else or authorised by someone else, or (ii) he altered or tampered a document, or (iii) he obtained a document by practicing deception, or from a person not in control of his senses.12. Making of any false document, in view of the definition of 'forgery' is the sine qua non therefor. What would amount to making of a false document is specified in section 464 thereof. What is, therefore, necessary is to execute a document with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document inter alia was made by the authority of a person by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made.13. In the case of Mir Nagvi Askari v CBI, the Court held that:\nA person is said to make a false document or record if he satisfies one of the three conditions as noticed hereinbefore and provided for under the said section. The first condition being that the document has been falsified with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document has been made by a person, by whom the person falsifying the document knows that it was not made. Clearly the documents in question in the present case, even if it be assumed to have been made dishonestly or fraudulently, had not been made with the intention of causing it to be believed that they were made by or under the authority of some one else. The second criteria of the section deals with a case where a person without lawful authority alters a document after it has been made. There has been no allegation of alteration of the voucher in question after they have been made. Therefore in our opinion the second criteria of the said section is also not applicable to the present case. The third and final condition of Section 464 deals with a document, signed by a person who due to his mental capacity does not know the contents of the documents which were made i.e because of intoxication or unsoundness of mind etc. Such is also not the case before us. Indisputably therefore the accused before us could not have been convicted with the making of a false document.14.\n\nTo attract the second clause of section 464 there has to be alteration of document dishonestly and fraudulently. So in order to attract the clause 'secondly' if the document is to be altered it has to be for some gain or with such objective on the part of the accused. Merely changing a document does not make it a false document.15."

Under section 463 the making of a false document with any of the intents therein mentioned is forgery, and section 464 sets forth when a person is said to make a 'false document' within the meaning of the Code.\nThe definition of forgery in the Code is not as simple and clear as the definition of forgery in common law. Forgery in common law is defined as the fraudulent making or alteration of a writing to the prejudice of another man's right."

      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "The elements of forgery are—\n\n1. The making of a false document or part of it.\n2. Such making should be with the intent\n(a) to cause damage or injury to (i) public, or (ii) any person; or\n(b) to support any claim or title; or\n(c) to cause any person to part with property; or\n(d) to cause any person to enter into express or implied contract; or\n(e) to commit fraud or that fraud may be committed.\n\n1. 'Makes any false document'.— A school inspector prepared under his own signature false pay bills containing false claims for salaries of teachers who had not worked within his jurisdiction, some of whom being purely fictitious, and encashed them from the treasury. He was held to be guilty of making a false document but not of forgery because he had not made the signature or writing of another, nor had altered the pay bills.18.\nThe antedating of a document is not forgery, unless it has or could have operated to the prejudice of some one.19. Incorporation or inclusion of a false statement in a document would not ipso facto make the document false. For a document to be false, it has to tell a lie about itself.20."

    "section465.2": {
      "title": "Publication of book.—",
      "content": "There was allegation that the accused person, in order to induce the public to purchase the book, falsely represented that the book was by a certain person. There was no allegation that the accused himself had written the book and represented it to be that of some other person. The Court said such allegations, even if true, do not make out a case of forgery. The offence of cheating could not also be said to have been made out because it was a consequential offence.21.\nWhere the allegation was that the accused, who was working as a stenographer in the High Court, had fabricated a forged bail order and the evidence showed that the bail order in question was in fact written by the accused, the finding of the High Court that the paper could not be said to be a document in the absence of signature of the accused was held to be not tenable. The document could have been used for causing wrongful loss or obtaining wrongful gain. Hence, the offence under sections 466 and 468 was made out.22.\n2. 'To cause damage or injury to the public or to any person'.—The damage or injury must be intended to be caused by the false document to the public or any individual.23. Thus, a police-officer who alters his diary so as to show that he had not kept certain persons under surveillance does not commit forgery, inasmuch as there is no risk of loss or injury to any individual and the element of fraud as defined in section 25 is absent.24. It is the intent to cause damage or injury which constitutes the gist of this offence. It is immaterial whether damage, injury or fraud is actually caused or not.25. Mere making of a false document would not constitute defrauding unless injury or intent to cause injury to the person deceived was also proved.26.\nTo tamper with a proceeding in a Court of Justice in order to obtain from the Court a decision or order, which it otherwise would not make, is as much a public mischief as to attempt to secure the unauthorised release of a prisoner from jail or to obtain for an unqualified person credentials entitling him to practise as a surgeon or to navigate a ship.27.\n3. 'Support any claim or title'.—Even if a man has a legal claim or title to property, he will be guilty of forgery if he counterfeits documents in order to support it. See illustrations (f), (g), (h) and (i). An actual intention to convert an illegal or doubtful claim into an apparently legal one is dishonesty and will amount to forgery.28.\nThe term 'claim' is not limited in its application to a claim to property. It may be a claim to anything, as for instance, a claim to a woman as the claimant's wife, a claim to the custody of a child as being the claimant's child, or a claim to be admitted to attendance at a law class in a college, or to be admitted to a university or other examination, or a claim to the possession of immovable or any other kind of property.29.\n4. 'To cause any person to part with property'.—It is not necessary that the property with which it is intended that false document shall cause a person to part should be in existence at the time when the false document was made. For example, if A gave an order to B to buy the material for making and to make a silver tea service for him, and C, before the tea service was made or the materials for making it had been bought were to make a false letter purporting, but falsely, to be signed by A, authorizing B to deliver to D the tea service when made, C would have committed forgery within the meaning of section 463 by making that false document with intent to cause B to part with property, namely, the tea service, when made.30. A written certificate has been held to be 'property' within the meaning of this section.31.\n\n5. 'Intent to commit fraud'.—The Supreme Court had held that the expression \"defraud\" involves two elements, namely, deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss that is deprivation of property, whether movable or immovable, or of money, and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or such others. In short, it is a non-economic or non-pecuniary loss. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver will almost always cause loss or detriment to the deceived. Even in those rare cases where there is a benefit or advantage to the deceiver, but no corresponding loss to the deceived the second condition is satisfied.32.\n6. 'Fraudulently'.—This word is used in sections 471 and 464 together with the word 'dishonestly' and presumably in a sense not covered by the latter word. If, however, it be held that 'fraudulently' implies deprivation, either actual or intended, then apparently that word would perform no function which would not have been fully discharged by the word 'dishonestly' and its use would be mere surplusage. So far as such a consideration carries any weight, it obviously inclines in favour of the view that the word 'fraudulently' should not be confined to transactions of which deprivation of property forms a part.33.\n7. 'Makes'.—\"The 'making of a document, or part of a document, does not mean 'writing' or 'printing' it, but signing or otherwise executing it; as in legal phrase we speak of 'making an indenture' or 'making a promissory note', by which is not meant the writing out of the form of the instrument, but the sealing or signing it as a deed or note. The fact that the word 'makes' is used in the section in conjunction with the words 'signs', 'seals' or 'executes', or 'makes any mark denoting the execution', etc., seems to very clearly to denote that this is its true meaning. What constitutes a false document or part of a document is not the writing of any number of words which in themselves are innocent, but affixing the seal or signature of some person to the document, or part of a document, knowing that the seal or signature is not his, and that he gave no authority to affix it. In other words, the falsity consists in the document, or part of a document, being signed or sealed with the name or seal of a person who did not in fact sign or seal it\".34."

The reliance on the false documents will not ipso facto implicate the person who relied upon, under sections 465 and 466.44. If by virtue of preparing a false document purporting it to be a document of a Court of Justice and by virtue of such document, a person who is not entitled to be released on bail could be released then, undoubtedly damage or injury has been caused to the public at large and, therefore, there is no reason why under such circumstances the accused who is the author of such forged document cannot be said to have committed offence under section 466 of IPC, 1860. A person is said to do a thing fraudulently if he does that thing with intent to defraud but not otherwise. The expression 'defraud' involves two elements, namely deceit and injury to the person deceived. Injury is something other than economic loss and it will include any harm whatever caused to any person in body, mind, reputation or such others. A benefit or advantage to the deceiver will almost always cause loss or detriment to the deceived. The preparation of a forged bail order by the utilisation of which the person concerned obtained an advantage of being released deceiving the courts and the society at large cannot but be said to have made the document fraudulently, thereby attracting section 466 of IPC, 1860.45.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n42.

      "content": "Whoever forges a document which purports to be a valuable security or a will, or an authority to adopt a son, or which purports to give authority to any person to make or transfer any valuable security, or to receive the principal, interest or dividends thereon, or to receive or deliver any money, movable property, or valuable security, or any document purporting to be an acquittance or receipt acknowledging the payment of money, or an acquittance or receipt for the delivery of any movable property or valuable security, shall be punished with 46.[imprisonment for life], or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThe offence under this section is an aggravated form of the offence described in the preceding section. The forged document must be one of those mentioned in the section. A complaint by the court is necessary for cognizance of the offence.47. Section 467, IPC, 1860, does not require the prosecution to prove that the accused who commits forgery, has benefitted thereby or any loss has occasioned to anyone thereby.48. There is a fundamental difference between a person executing a sale deed claiming that the property conveyed is his property, and a person executing a sale deed by impersonating the owner or falsely claiming to be authorised or empowered by the owner, to execute the deed on owner's behalf. When a person executes a document conveying a property describing it as his, there are two possibilities. The first is that he has a bona fide belief that the property actually belongs to him. The second is that he may be dishonestly or fraudulently claiming it to be his even though he knows that it is not his property. But to fall under first category of \"false documents\", it is not sufficient that a document has been made or executed dishonestly or fraudulently. There is a further requirement that it should have been made with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document was made or executed by, or by the authority of a person, by whom or by whose authority he knows that it was not made or executed. When a document is executed by a person claiming a property which is not his, he is not claiming that he is someone else nor is he claiming that he is authorised by someone else. Therefore, execution of such document (purporting to convey some property of which he is not the owner) is not execution of a false document as defined under section 464 of the Code. If what is executed is not a false document, there is no forgery. If there is no forgery, then neither section 467 nor section 471 of the Code is attracted.49."

Precise details of all the fictitious accounts as also the further flow of money realized on encashment of demand drafts/pay orders have been incorporated in the charge sheet additionally, by allegedly claiming depreciation on the new machinery, which was never purchased, on the basis of forged invoices, etc.; the accused cheated the public exchequer as well. The Supreme Court held that proceedings are not liable to be quashed merely because dues of bank have been paid up.51.\nA deed of agreement for purchase of shares is not a valuable security.52. A person who received money from a postman under a false representation that he was the payee when in fact he was not, and signed the postal acknowledgement in the name of the payee, was held to have committed an offence under this section.53. Where the accused fraudulently brought into existence a registered sale deed, said to have been executed by the widow of a person, intending to deceive and also to injure the reversioners of that person, it was held that they were guilty under this section.54. Where the accused falsely identified a person before the Oaths Commissioner as the deponent and the said person affixed his thumb impression on the document and it was also apparent that the document could not even become an affidavit without identification of the deponent by the accused, it was held that the accused abettor having been present at the time of the commission of the offence of impersonation he was guilty under section 467 read with section 114, IPC, 1860.55. A bank draft is a security for the purposes of this section and the bank manager signing a forged draft is guilty of this offence.56.

What is material is the intention or purpose of the offender in committing forgery.61. Where documents had been forged and fabricated only to be used as genuine to make fraudulent and illegal claim over land owned by complainant, the Supreme Court held that it cannot be held that respondents were not makers of documents or that filing of civil suit based on same would not constitute an offence.62. The Supreme Court has expressed the opinion that the conduct of an Advocate's clerk in forging the signature of another advocate on a surety bond and forging some endorsements for identification and attestation, would not constitute an offence under this section and that the conviction should have been under section 465.63."

      "content": "Where there is forgery of a document purporting to be a valuable security as defined in section 471 becomes an offence under section 471 when it is used as genuine. The Supreme Court observed that the basic ingredient of both the offences is that there should be \"forgery\" as defined in section 463 and forgery in turn depends upon creation of a \"false document\" as defined in section 464. If there is no \"false document\" as defined in section 464, offences under sections 467 and 471 are not made out. Further the mere execution of a sale deed by claiming that property being sold was executant's property did not amount to commission of offences under sections 467 and 471 even if title to property did not vest in the executant. This was for the reason that no \"false document\" as defined in section 464, was created.74.\n\n2. 'Knows or has reason to believe to be a forged document'.—These words are of general application.75. Where it was not shown that the accused had knowledge of the forged nature of the cheque76. or the lottery ticket77. which he used as genuine he cannot be convicted under sections 467 and 471, IPC, 1860.\n\"Knowledge\" is an awareness on the part of the person concerned indicating his state of mind. Reason to believe is another fact of the state of mind. It is not the same thing as \"suspicion\" or \"doubt\". The mere seeing also cannot be equated to believing. \"Reason to believe\" is a higher level of the state of mind. Likewise knowledge will be slightly on a higher plane than reason to believe. A person can be supposed to know when there is a direct appeal to his senses and a person is presumed to have reason to believe if he has sufficient cause to believe the same. In substance, what is meant is that a reason to believe requires that a reasonable man would, by probable reasoning conclude or infer regarding the nature of the thing concerned. \"Knowledge\" and \"reason to believe\" has to be deduced from the various circumstances of the case.78. The section is intended to apply to persons other than the forger himself but the forger is not excluded from the operation of the section.

So both elements must be present and in other words it would mean that the act should be a wilful act and should also be done with an intention to defraud. While trying to define \"intent to defraud\", the Court noted that it contains two elements, deceit and injury. There is no doubt that to convict a person under section 477-A IPC, the prosecution has to prove that there was a wilful act, which had been made with an intent to defraud and while proving \"Intention to defraud\" the prosecution has to further prove two elements that the act was an act of deceit and it had caused an injury. In the present case, there may be an injury, but there is no deceit.105."

Looking at the afore-stated section, it is clear that the accused must induce a woman, who is not lawfully married to him, to believe that he is married to her and as a result of the afore-stated representation, the woman should believe that she was lawfully married to him and there should be cohabitation or sexual intercourse as a result of the deception. The essence of an offence under section 493 IPC, 1860 is, therefore, practice of deception by a man on a woman as a consequence of which the woman is led to believe that she is lawfully married to him although she is not and then make her cohabit with him.1.

      "title": "Proof of marriage.—",
      "content": "Section 493 IPC, 1860 do not presuppose a marriage between the accused and the victim necessarily by following a ritual or marriage by customary ceremony. What has been clearly laid down and emphasised is that there should be an inducement of belief in the woman that she is lawfully married to the accused/ appellant and the inducement of belief of a lawful marriage cannot be interpreted so as to mean or infer that the marriage necessarily had to be in accordance with any custom or ritual or under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. If the evidence on record indicate inducement of a belief in any manner in the woman which cannot possibly be enlisted but from which it can reasonably be inferred by ordinary prudence that she is a lawfully married wife of the man accused of an offence under section 493 IPC, 1860 the same will have to be treated as sufficient material to bring home the guilt under section 493 IPC, 1860.\n\nInterpretation of the section in any other manner including an assertion that the marriage should have been performed by customary rituals or in similar manner only in order to establish that a belief of marriage had been induced, is bound to frustrate the very object and purpose of the provision for which it has been incorporated in the IPC, 1860 which is clearly to prevent the deceitful act of a man inducing the belief of a lawful marriage for the purpose of cohabitation merely to satisfy his lust for sexual pleasure.3.\nWhere a man and woman exchanged garlands, the man promising to marry formally, and had sex as a result of which the woman became pregnant, it was held that the exchange of garlands did not amount to falsely inducing the woman to believe that she was married to the man. Section 493 was not attracted.4. Where a woman married a man with full knowledge that he was already a married man and there was no proof that the man falsely induced her to believe anything, it was held that the ingredients of the offence under section 493 were not made out.5."

It is an independent offence, the cognizance of which can be taken by the Court on the basis of complaint filed by the complainant herself, therefore, the offence punishable under section 376 of IPC, 1860 is not made out as the alleged act of sexual intercourse by the petitioner with the complainant may fall within the category of sections 493 and 495 of IPC, 1860 but not in the category of rape as defined in section 375 of IPC, 1860 and made punishable under section 376 of IPC; therefore, the cognizance of section 376 of IPC, 1860 is against the settled principles of law.6."

      "title": "Second marriage under Special Marriage Act, 1954.—",
      "content": "SI Jafri J, of the Allahabad High Court observed:16.\n\nNotwithstanding the fact that the personal law permits a muslim male to contract four marriages, if a second marriage is contracted under the Special Marriage Act 1954 vis-a-vis the fact that he has a legally wedded wife who has been married to him under the Mohammedan law, s. 494 has to claw at the erring male … Mohammedan law does not take preference over Special Marriage Act 1954 … There being no saving clause for the applicant to purge him of the charges u/s. 494 …, the applicant is liable to be punished under [this section].\n\n2. 'Marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife'.—The Supreme Court has observed that prima facie, the expression \"whoever marries\" must mean \"whoever marries validly\" or \"whoever … marries and whose marriage is a valid one\". If the marriage is not a valid one according to the law applicable to the parties no question of its being void by reason of its taking place during the life of the wife or the husband of the person arises. If the marriage is not a valid marriage, it is no marriage in the eyes of the law.17. The Supreme Court in another case had held that in a bigamy case, the second marriage as a fact, that is to say, the essential ceremonies constituting it, must be proved.18. Admission of marriage by the accused is not evidence of it for the purposes of proving marriage in an adultery or bigamy case.19. Thus, where the second Hindu marriage was not proved by showing saptapadi and homam, the mere production of a marriage certificate under section 16 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 would not be sufficient to prove that the second marriage was performed validly by performing all the essential ceremonies of a valid marriage. The mere fact of subsequent registration of the second marriage does not prove the validity of second marriage.20. Merely because the second marriage even if performed by performing all the essential ceremonies turns out to be void by virtue of section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it cannot be said that section 494, IPC, 1860 will not be attracted.21. If the second marriage was not proved to have been validly performed by observing essential ceremonies and customs in the community, the conviction under section 494, IPC, 1860 could not be maintained.22. Perhaps the Courts in India were obliged to take the view they have taken because of the word \"solemnised\" occurring in section 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and the inhibition contained in the proviso to section 50 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1972 which forbids taking into consideration even the opinion of a person with special means of\n\nknowledge to show that the two persons were always received and treated as husband and wife by their friends and relatives so far offences under sections 494, 495, etc., IPC, 1860 are concerned.23.\nThus, if one deliberately keeps a small lacuna, e.g., instead of taking the seven steps (saptapadi), takes only six steps while celebrating the second marriage, one can easily avoid the penalty prescribed by these sections even though one virtually ruins the lives of two girls. If we are to effectively root out polygamy from this country, we must amend s. 494, IPC, and s. 17 of the Hindu Marriage Act, in such a way that anyone who goes through a form of marriage during the lifetime of his or her spouse will come within the mischief of the offence of bigamy. At the same time we should also delete from the proviso to s. 50 of the Indian Evidence Act, the last portion which says 'or in prosecutions u/s. 494, 495, 497 or 498 of the Indian Penal Code'. The National Committee on the Status of Women too made, more or less, similar recommendations in its report. It is also felt that ss. 493, 494, 495 and 496, IPC, which have an element of cheating in them and affect unsophisticated rural women more than women in urban areas should be made cognizable so that these poor women could get justice without being required to engage lawyers at their own cost.24.\n\nThe Courts are also changing their viewpoint. In Indu Bhagya Natekar v Bhagya Pandurang Natekar,25. it was held that it is not correct to say that in every case of bigamy, unless the second marriage can be proved by bringing in the evidence of the performance of ceremonies itself, a conviction under section 494 is virtually impossible. The accused can be convicted even if there is other reliable evidence to establish the charge.\nWhere in a particular community 'saptapadi' was not an essential ceremony, the provisions of section 7-A of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 applied and, therefore, the performance of other ceremonies prevalent in the community constituted a valid marriage.26.\nUnder the provisions of the Indian Christian Marriage Act (XV of 1872), the first accused, who was a Roman Catholic Indian Christian, married the complainant, who was a Protestant, in a Protestant Church, the ceremony being performed by a Protestant Pastor, and subsequently, after obtaining a release deed from her, he married the second accused in a Roman Catholic Church, the ceremony being performed by a Roman Catholic priest. It was held that the first accused had committed the offence of bigamy punishable under this section. The release deed executed by the complainant did not operate as a dissolution of the marriage between the first accused and herself. The marriage between the first accused and the complainant was a legal and valid marriage and, as it was subsisting when the first accused married the second accused, the marriage of the first accused with the second accused was void by reason of its taking place during the life of the complainant.27.\nGood faith and mistake of law are no defences to a charge of bigamy.28."

It is undisputed that accused first got married to Smt.

Act 3 of 1992, w.e.f. 15-2-1992.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nIn Joseph Shine v UOI,45. a Constitution bench of the Supreme Court decriminalised adultery and held section 497 of the IPC, 1860 unconstitutional as violative of Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Under section 397 a man who had sex with a married woman without getting her husband's permission could be charged and face punishment with imprisonment for a term up to five years, or with fine, or with both, if convicted. Before, it was struck down, the cognizance of the offence was limited to adultery committed with a married woman, and the male offender alone was made liable to punishment. Thus, under the Code, adultery was an offence committed by a third person against a husband in respect of his wife. A married man was not liable if had sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman, or with a widow, or even with a married woman whose husband consented to it.\nPrior to the judgment in Joseph Shine case, the Supreme Court in Sowmithri Vishnu's case46. had upheld the constitutional validity of section 497, IPC, 1860. In Joseph Shine v UOI, AIR 2018 SC 4898 , the Supreme Court observed that: Adultery is different from an offence committed under Section 498-A or any violation of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 or, for that matter, the protection conceived of under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure or Sections 306 or 304B or 494 IPC. These offences are meant to sub-serve various other purposes relating to a matrimonial relationship and extinction of life of a married woman during subsistence of marriage. Treating adultery an offence would tantamount to the State entering into a real private realm. The act, i.e., adultery does not fit into the concept of a crime. If it is treated as a crime, there would be immense intrusion into the extreme privacy of the matrimonial sphere. It is better to be left as a ground for divorce. For any other purpose as the Parliament has perceived or may, at any time, perceive, to treat it as a criminal offence will offend the two facets of Article 21 of the Constitution, namely, dignity of husband and wife, as the case may be, and the privacy attached to a relationship between the two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n45.

Entering or taking away somebody's wife for the purpose other than mentioned in section 498, IPC, 1860 does not constitute an offence. Therefore, in order to bring home guilt of a person under section 498, IPC, 1860, the prosecution has to prove that a married woman was enticed or taken away with an intention that she might have illicit intercourse with any person.47.\nSections 361 and 366 may be compared with this section, which may come into operation when the two former sections fail to apply, but only in respect of a married woman. This and the preceding sections are evidently intended for the protection of husbands, who alone can institute prosecutions for offences under them.\nThe gist of the offence under this section appears to be the deprivation of the husband of his custody and his proper control over his wife with the object of having illicit intercourse with her.48."

      "content": "A comparison of the ingredients constituting an offence under sections 366 and 498 shows that though there are some ingredients which are common, but the ingredients for the offence under section 498 constitute of some of the very important particulars which are not in an offence under section 366, IPC, 1860. The additional ingredients of\n\nsection 498, IPC, 1860 namely, (i) that the woman said to have been taken away is the married wife of another man, and (ii) that the accused has taken her away with the knowledge that she is the wife of that person are not at all in the offence under section 366, IPC, 1860. Therefore, the offence under section 498 cannot be said to be a minor offence or an offence under section 366 within the meaning of the term used in section 222(2) of the Cr PC, 1973.49.\n1. 'Detains with that intent any such woman'.—The word \"detains\" means \"keeps back\". The keeping back need not necessarily be by physical force, it may be by persuasion or by allurement and blandishment. The use of the word requires that there should be something in the nature of control or influence which can properly be described as a keeping back of the woman. To constitute detention proof of some kind of persuasion is necessary. It cannot properly be said that a man detains a woman if she has no desire to leave and on the contrary wishes to stay with him.50. The Supreme Court has held that the keeping back may be by force, but it need not be by force. It can be the result of persuasion, allurement or blandishment, which may either have caused the willingness of the woman, or may have encouraged, or co-operated with, her initial inclination to leave her husband.51.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n47.

Section 499, IPC, 1860 emphasises the words \"makes or publishes\". The gist of the offence of defamation lies in the dissemination of the harmful imputation. When a defamatory statement is published, it is not only the publisher, but also the maker who becomes responsible and it is in that context that the word \"makes\" is used in section 499 IPC, 1860. It is of essence that in order to constitute the offence of defamation, it must be communicated to a third person because what is intended by the imputation is to arouse hostility of others. Therefore, in brief, the essentials of defamation are, first, the words must be defamatory; second, they must refer to the aggrieved party; third, they must be maliciously published.1."

The right to enjoyment of a private reputation, unassailed by malicious slander is of ancient origin, and is necessary to human society. A good reputation is an element of personal security, and is protected by the Constitution equally with the right to the enjoyment of life, liberty and property.3. The term 'person' includes not only the physical body and members but also every bodily sense and personal attribute among which is the reputation a man has acquired. Reputation can also be defined to be good name, the credit, honour or character which is derived from a favourable public opinion or esteem, and character by report. The right to enjoyment of a good reputation is a valuable privilege of ancient origin and necessary to human society. 'Reputation' is an element of personal security and is protected by Constitution equally with the right to enjoyment of life, liberty and property. Although, 'character' and 'reputation' are often used synonymously, these terms are distinguishable. 'Character' is what a man is and\n\n'reputation' is what he is supposed to be in what people say he is. 'Character' depends on attributes possessed and 'reputation' on attributes which others believe one to possess.

The Court observed thus:\nOne cannot be unmindful that right to freedom of speech and expression is a highly valued and cherished right but the Constitution conceives of reasonable restriction. In that context criminal defamation which is in existence in the form of ss. 499 and 500 Indian Penal Code is not a restriction on free speech that can be characterized as disproportionate. Right to free speech cannot mean that a citizen can defame the other. Protection of reputation is a fundamental right. It is also a human right. Cumulatively it serves the social interest.\n\nThe Apex Court did not accept that the provisions relating to criminal defamation are not saved by the doctrine of proportionality, because it determines a limit which is not impermissible within the criterion of reasonable restriction.

    "section500.1": {
      "title": "Ingredients.—",
      "content": "The section requires three essentials:—\n\n1. Making or publishing any imputation concerning any person.\n\n2. Such imputation must have been made by\n\n(a) words, either spoken or intended to be read; or\n(b) signs; or\n(c) visible representations.\n\n3. Such imputation must have been made with the intention of harming or with knowledge or reason to believe that it will harm the reputation of the person concerning whom it is made.7. It is clear that intention to cause harm is the most essential sine qua non for an offence under section 499, IPC, 1860. An offence punishable under section 500, IPC, 1860 requires blameworthy mind and is not a statutory offence requiring any mens rea.8.\n\n1. 'Makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person'.—Everyone who composes, dictates, writes or in any way contributes to the making of a libel, is the maker of the libel. If one dictates, and another writes, both are guilty of making it, for he shows his approbation of what he writes. So, if one repeats, another writes a libel, and a third approved what is written they are all makers of it, as all who concur and assent to the doing of an unlawful act are guilty; and murdering a man's reputation by a libel may be compared to murdering a man's person, in which all who are present and encourage the act are guilty, though the wound was given by one only.9. The mechanic or the compositor of the Press does neither 'make nor publish' the matter that may be impugned as defamatory.10. Intention on the part of the accused to harm the reputation or the knowledge or reasonable belief that an imputation will harm the reputation of the person concerned being an essential ingredient of the offence of defamation, the Chairman of a Company owning the newspaper in which the offending news item is published cannot be held liable unless it is shown that he was somehow\n\nconcerned with the publication of the defamatory news item. Under section 7 of the Press and Registration of Books Act, 1867 a presumption regarding awareness of the contents of a newspaper can be raised only against the Editor whose name appears on the copy of the newspaper and no other Editors like the News Editor or Resident Editor whose names do not appear in the declaration printed on the copy of the newspaper.11."

      "title": "'Publishes'.—",
      "content": "The defamatory matter must be published, that is, communicated to some person other than the person about whom it is addressed, e.g., dictating a letter to a clerk is publication.12. Imputations in a charge sheet which is sent to the employee himself does not amount to a publication.13. But where there is a duty which forms the ground of privileged occasion, the person exercising the privilege may communicate matters to a third person in the ordinary course of business. A solicitor who dictates to his clerk a letter containing defamatory statements regarding a person is not liable for defamation.14. Where the complainant's Advocate sent a notice to a party whose Advocate dictated a reply to his steno containing defamatory remarks and the same was sent to the complainant's Advocate, the Kerala High Court held that this did not amount to any publication.15.\n\nCommunicating defamatory matter only to the person defamed is not publication.16. The action of a person who sent to a public officer by post, in a closed cover, a notice containing imputations on the character of the recipient but which was not communicated by the accused to any third person was held to be not such a 'making' or 'publishing' of the matter complained of as to constitute this offence.17. A notice under a Municipal Act was issued by the President of the Municipal Committee to a certain person, who sent a reply containing defamatory allegations against the President. This reply was put on the official file by the President and it was read by the members of the Committee. It was held that there was publication of the defamation. The placing of the reply on the official file was not a gratuitous or voluntary act on the part of the President but it was his duty to do so, and the accused knew or must have known that the contents of his reply would be necessarily communicated to the members of the Committee.18.\nWhere the alleged defamatory words were sent to the complainant by registered post, it was held that there was no publication. There was absence of one of the necessary ingredients of the offence, namely publication. The complaint was liable to be quashed.19.\n\nDefamatory matter written on a postcard20. or printed on papers distributed or broadcast,21. constitutes publication. So is the filing in a Court of a petition containing defamatory matter concerning a person with the intention that it should be read by other persons.22. When a person presents a defamatory petition to a superior public officer, who, in the ordinary course of official routine, sends it to some subordinate officer for inquiry, there is a publication of the letter at the place where he may receive it, and publication for which the original writer may prima facie be held responsible, whether or not he expressly asks for an inquiry.23. Communication to a husband or wife of a charge against the wife or husband is publication,24. but uttering of a libel by a husband to his wife is not, as in England they are one in the eye of the law.25.\nWhere a libel is printed, the sale of each copy is a distinct publication and a fresh offence; and conviction or acquittal on an indictment for publishing one copy will be no bar to an indictment for publishing another copy.26.\n\nThe person who publishes the imputation need not necessarily be the author of the imputation. The person who publishes and the person who makes an imputation are alike guilty.27."

Where a complaint was filed with regard to a statement made by the Gujarat Chief Minister published in media or newspaper or over television or through internet that ex-Prime Minister late Hon'ble Shri Jawahar Lal Nehru did nothing for children.

The culpability in such cases does not depend upon the circumstances where he has tried to undo the wrong which he has committed or not put up on fact he has acted with care or attention or has done so rashly or negligently, it is no defence in the matter of defamation for the accused to say that he has acted on the information given to him by another. It is for him to establish that the source on which he acted is a proper source on which he is entitled and he did with care and circumspection. Therefore, the editor and publisher are liable for the baseless and false matter which was published in the journal. Such an irresponsible conduct and attitude on the part of the editor and publisher cannot be said to be done in good faith.32. In the matter of defamation the position of newspaper is not in any way different from that of member of the public in general. The responsibility in either case is the same.33. The publisher of a newspaper is responsible for defamatory matter published in such paper whether he knows the contents of such paper or not.34. But it would be a sufficient answer to a charge of defamation against the editor of a newspaper if he proved that the libel was published in his absence and without his knowledge and he had in good faith entrusted the temporary management of the newspaper during his absence to a\n\ncompetent person.35. The owner of a journal in order to be liable under section 499 has to have direct responsibility for the publication of the defamatory statement and he must also have the intention to harm, or knowledge or reason to believe that the imputation will harm the reputation of person concerned. The owner of a journal qua has no responsibility under the section.36. The prosecution of the chairman and managing director of a company owning the newspaper for the publication of defamatory article in the newspaper by reason of their holding those posts would be invalid unless their personal involvement in the publication of the article is established.37.\n\nWhere a newspaper carried extracts from a book written on one of the former Prime Ministers of India containing imputations of corruption, the editor of the newspaper was liable to be prosecuted. His plea that he was only a publisher and not the author of the extracts was held to be not tenable. It was alleged that there was a criminal conspiracy in the matter between the managing editor, resident editor and executing editor. All of them were liable to be prosecuted.38. A chief editor of a newspaper cannot say that he is not responsible for selection and publication of matters in the newspaper. A complaint against the chief editor is maintainable.39.\nThe sending of a newspaper, containing defamatory matter by post from Calcutta, where it is published, addressed to a subscriber at Allahabad, is publication of such defamatory matter at Allahabad.40."

It cannot be said that the act of publication comes to an end as soon as the issue of the newspaper is released at one place.

Advocates as a class are incapable of being defamed.51.

The photographs during a protest demonstration a protest demonstration and depicted the sequence of events when the complainant was being pulled out of a police jeep. It can never be stated that the publication of the photographs in the newspaper was with the intention or with knowledge or having reason to believe that it will harm the reputation of the complainant. Proceedings are liable to be quashed.58.\n\n3. 'Intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm'.—In this section the expression \"harm\" means harm to the reputation of the aggrieved party.59. It is not necessary to prove that the complainant actually suffered directly or indirectly from the scandalous imputation alleged; it is sufficient to show that the accused intended to harm, or knew, or had reason to believe that the imputation made by him would harm the reputation of the complainant.60. A statement made primarily with the object that the person making it should escape from a difficulty\n\ncannot be made the subject of a criminal charge merely because it contains matter which may be harmful to the reputation of other people or hurtful to their feelings.61.\nThe meaning to be attached to the word 'harm' is not the ordinary sense in which it is used. By 'harm' is meant imputation on a man's character made and expressed to others so as to lower him in their estimation. Anything which lowers him merely in his own estimation does not constitute defamation.62. Accusing a person in front of the public, of having illicit relations with accuser's sister cannot be considered to have been uttered merely as scurrilous abuse in the situation in which they were used against the accused.

      "content": "Imputation concerning company, association or collection of persons.—An action for libel will lie at the suit of an incorporated trading company in respect of a libel calculated to injure its reputation in the way of its business.66. The words complained of must attack the corporation or company in the method of conducting its affairs, must accuse it of fraud or mismanagement or must attack its financial position.67. A corporation has no reputation apart from its property or trade. It cannot maintain an action for a libel merely affecting personal reputation. The words complained of, to support a prosecution, must reflect on the management of its business and must injuriously affect the corporation, as distinct from the individuals who compose it. They must attack the corporation in its method of conducting its affairs, must accuse it of fraud or mismanagement or must attack its financial position. A corporation cannot bring a prosecution for words which merely affect its honour or dignity.68.\nA prosecution lies for libelling Hindu widows as a class.69. Where the defamatory articles, published in a newspaper, related to the habitual immoral conduct of the girls of a particular college, but no particular girl or girls were named in or identifiable from the articles, and the complaint was filed by a number of girls of the college, it was held that the author of the articles was guilty of defamation, in as much as the inevitable effect of the articles on the mind of the reader must be to make him believe that it was habitual with the girls of the college to misbehave in the ways mentioned so that all the girls in the college collectively and each girl individually must suffer in reputation.70.\n\nThis Explanation covers any collection of persons but such collection of persons must be identifiable in the sense that one could with certainty say that this group of particular people has been defamed as distinguished from the rest of the community. Public Prosecutors and Assistant Public Prosecutors at Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh were held to be an identifiable group and hence, could be the subject of defamation according to the Supreme Court.71. In this connection see para captioned \"Concerning any Person\" and the cases mentioned therein.\nThe offending article must carry an imputation against a definite and ascertainable body of people. A complaint was not allowed to be continued where the article published in a magazine carried imputations against a certain community in general and not against any particular group, nor the community was found to be a definite and identifiable body of people and the imputations also did not relate to the complainant.72. Where a news in a local daily about insufficiency of sandal wood pieces at the cremation of the President of a National Political Party was published, but no defamatory words or imputation against the said political party was used in the news item and it did not refer to any definite or determinate person or persons, it was held that offence of defamation was not constituted.73."

A member of the House of Commons has an absolute privilege in respect of what he has spoken within the four walls of the House but there is only a qualified privilege in his favour even in respect of what he has himself said in the House, if he causes the same to be published in the public press. Where a member of a State Legislature got published in the press a question which the member had sought to put in the House but which the Speaker had disallowed and the question contained defamatory imputations regarding\n\nthe character of a person, it was held that the publication was not accepted by any of the exceptions to section 499.78.\nA minister was questioned about misappropriation of Government funds. He replied by saying that the preliminary enquiry made by the government showed that some misappropriation had taken place. He also disclosed the names of the persons involved including that of the complainant as indicated in the report. This part of the proceedings was published in the newspaper of the accused. Since the newspaper exercised its qualified privilege in good faith, it was held that there was no intention to cause harm to the reputation of the complainant.79."

They only require that it should be made in good faith. When truth is set up as a defence, it must extend to the entire libel and it is not sufficient that only a part of the libel is proved to be true.80.\nThe truth of the imputation complained of shall amount to defence if it was for the public benefit that the imputation should be published, but not otherwise. A Court may find that an imputation is true, and made for the public good, but on considering the manner of the publication (e.g., in a newspaper) it may hold that the particular publication is not for the public good, and is, therefore, not privileged.81. To get the benefit of this exception the accused must prove that the statement made by him is true in its substance and effect and not in part. Whether or not the statement was made for public good, an enquiry must be directed to the benefit that the publication has rendered or sought to render to the public or to a section of the public and whether the matter did concern the public.82."

It was held that, had such persons contented themselves with announcing the determination of the committee and the grounds upon which such determination was based, they would have been protected, but in as much as they went further and made false and uncalled for statements regarding C; they had not acted in good faith.83. If a person really was outcasted, a statement to the members of the brotherhood that he was outcasted is the kind of statement contemplated by the expression \"public good\".84. Where there exists a civil dispute between the parties as to the property where school is situated and run by complainant, which is admittedly pending in civil Court, mere alerting by accused to parents to take admission of their children at their own risk in school or in summer camp cannot be considered as defamatory or affecting the reputation or character of complainant.

A writer in a public paper has the same right as any other person, and it is his privilege, if indeed it is not his duty, to comment on the act of public men which concern not himself only but which concern the public, and the discussion of which is for the public good. And where a person makes the public conduct of a public man the subject of comment and it is for the public good, he is not liable to an action if the comments are made honestly, and he honestly believes the facts to be as he states them, and there is no wilful misrepresentation of fact or any misstatement which he must have known to be a misstatement, if he had exercised ordinary care.86. In order that a comment may be fair (a) it must be based on facts truly stated, (b) it must not impute corrupt or dishonourable motives to the person whose conduct or work is criticised except in so far as such imputations are warranted by the facts, (c) it must be the honest expression of the writer's real opinion made in good faith, and (d) it must be for the public good. The question to be considered in such cases is, would any fair man, however prejudiced he might be, or however exaggerated or obstinate his views may be, have made the criticism.87.\nAny opinion expressed in good faith made by a public servant would not amount to offence of defamation when public servant was acting in discharge of public functions. According to section 21 of the IPC, 1860, clause fifth, a member of Panchayat assisting a Court of justice is within the scope of definition of \"public servant\". Hence, opinion expressed by member of Panchayat in good faith to assist Court of Justice does not amount to defamation.88.\nThose who fill a public position must not be too thin skinned in reference to comments made upon them. Whoever fills a public position renders himself open to attack. He must accept an attack as a necessary, though unpleasant, appendage to his office.89.\nThe law of defamation under the IPC, 1860 cannot be equated with that of contempt of Court in general terms.90. The Court did not accept the proposition that a reply submitted to a contempt notice can in no case amount to contempt of Court in the light of the second exception to section 499.91."

It was held that in as much as such advertisement had the effect of making such hospital a \"public question\", M was within the third, sixth and ninth Exceptions.92. A newspaper carried a letter to the editor stating certain facts about a co-operative hospital to the effect that there were embezzlements; female nurses were harassed if they refused to attend night duty and that the President signed only convenient vouchers. It was held that this was an assertion of facts and not an expression of opinion. The mere fact that the letter demanded an inquiry would not convert the factual assertion into an opinion. The third Exception was not applicable.93.\n\nWhere the published statement was that the Marwari community had no faith and love towards India, their mother land, it was held that this was not sufficient to constitute the offence of defamation.

Comparative advertising is advertisement where a party advertises his goods or services by comparing them with goods and services of another party. This is generally done by either projecting that the advertiser's product is of same or superior quality to that of the compared product or by denigrating the quality of the compared product. The advertiser has right to boast of its technological superiority in comparison with product of the competitor. He can declare that his goods are better than that of his competitor. However, while doing so, he cannot disparage the goods of the competitor. Therefore, if the advertising is an insinuating campaign against the competitor's product such a negative campaigning is not permissible.96. The allegation was that advertisement published by petitioner along with Associated Traders at instance of petitioner disparaging respondents business. The Associated Traders had admitted that alleged advertisement was taken out by them on their own and Petitioner Company had nothing to do with that.

But in commenting on such matters, a public writer, as much as a private writer, is bound to attend to the truth, and to put forward the truth honestly and in good faith and to the best of his knowledge and ability. It is not to be expected that in discharging his duty of a public journalist he will always be infallible.

A man may in good faith complain of the conduct of a servant to the master of the servant even though the complaint amounts to defamation, but he is not protected if he publishes the complaint in a newspaper.

Where the complainant was dismissed from service on the allegation of theft of his master's property after a full domestic enquiry in which the complainant was given an opportunity to defend himself, the finding of such a domestic enquiry saying that the allegation was true could not form the basis of defamation case as it is fully protected by Exceptions 7 and 8 of section 499, IPC, 1860.

It is now a well-settled principle of law that those who plead exception must prove it. The burden of proof that his action was bona fide would, thus, be on the appellant alone. At this stage, in our opinion, it would have been premature for the High Court to consider the materials placed by the, appellant before it so as to arrive at a definite conclusion that there was no element of bad faith on the part of the appellant in making the said complaint before the police authorities.116."

Besides the bona fides of the person making the imputation, the person to whom the imputation is conveyed must have a common interest with the person making it which is served by the communication.117. The interest of the person referred to in this Exception has to be real and legitimate when communication is made in protection of the interest of the person making it. The privilege extends only to a communication upon the subject with respect to which the privilege extends and the privilege can be claimed in exercise of the right or safeguarding of the interest which creates the privilege.118. The regional\n\nmanager of a bank issued confidential circular to branch managers of his region advising them to be vigilant while dealing with persons included in the list including the complainant. The circular was issued in his official capacity in public interest and under instructions of the Central office. The Court said that the circular was covered by Exception 9. Therefore, even if the allegations made in the complaint were true, no offence would be made out under section 500.119.\nThis exception relates to private communication which a person makes in good faith for the protection of his own interest. This exception covers not only such allegations of facts as can be proved true but also expression of opinions and personal inferences. It has been incorporated to protect the interests of the parties in their business transaction which are generally done bona fide and, therefore, the rule of public good on which this principle is based is, that honest transaction of business and social intercourse would otherwise be deprived of the protection which they should enjoy. Whether any imputation made is with a motive or mala fide intention to lower the reputation or is made in good faith is to be determined from the facts and circumstances of the case. Undisputedly, the requirement of good faith and public good, both, are to be satisfied and the failure to prove good faith would exclude the application of Exception 9 in favour of the accused even if the requirement of public good is satisfied. The words 'good faith' as appearing in exception 9th not only require logical infallibility but also due care and attention.120.\nThis Exception refers to any imputation made in good faith, whereas the first Exception applies only to true imputation made for the public good. That he acted in good faith must be proved by the accused.121. Question of good faith is a question of fact and has to be decided in course of the trial and at the initial stage. The journalists do not enjoy any special privilege.122.\nIn determining the question of good faith, regard should be to the intellectual capacity of the accused, his predilections and the surrounding facts.123.\nWhere a rustic villager objected to the appointment of the complainant as a village munsiff in the bona fide belief that he was a rowdy and as such undesirable for a public post like this, it was held that he acted in good faith and was protected by this Exception.124.\nIn order to establish good faith and bona fides it has to be seen first the circumstances under which the defamatory matter was written or uttered; secondly, whether there was any malice; thirdly, whether the accused made any inquiry before he made the allegations; fourthly, whether there are reasons to accept the version that he acted with care and caution and finally whether there is preponderance of probability that the accused acted in good faith.125.\nThe burden lies on the person accused to prove the bona fide aspect of his publication. Cross-examination of the complainant can be used as a device for establishing good- faith. An imputation was made in a newspaper item that the complainant lady doctor had duped the Government by presenting false transfer allowance bills. The lady doctor's sole testimony that the publication harmed her reputation was held to be not sufficient to sustain her complaint. The accused showed that the publication was in good faith and in public interest.126.\nWhere the agreement for selling their properties for settling their dues was signed by the accused persons and registered before the Sub-Registrar in the presence of the accused but subsequently a publication in the newspaper was made by the accused after about two and a half months that the agreement was executed under compulsion, it was held that the publication was not made in 'good faith' and could not be brought under Exception 9 of section 499.127.\n\nThe ninth Exception to section 499 provides that it is not defamation to make an imputation on the character of another provided that the imputation be made in good faith for the protection of the interests of the person making it, or of any other person, or for the public good. Even if it is assumed that the accused No. 1 and other accused made the imputation against the respondent No. 1 that he had written the letters and thus, that imputation was made against his character, still that was made in good faith because they wanted protection of the interest of the members of the family of accused No. 1 and particularly his daughter. They did not approach any unconnected person, but police who could protect the interest of the accused No. 1 and his family members. In view of the legal position and the facts, which are clear from the complaint and the documents submitted with the complaint, it is clear that the case is clearly covered by Exceptions 8 and 9 and no case under section 500 IPC, 1860 could be made out.128."

      "content": "No Court shall take cognizance of this offence except upon a complaint made by the person aggrieved (section 199 Cr PC, 1973). The words \"person aggrieved\" does not mean \"person defamed\". The words \"person aggrieved\" has a wider connotation than the words \"person defamed\".152.\nA complaint for defamation by the person aggrieved by it can be entertained by a Court notwithstanding that the accused could have been prosecuted on the same facts under section 182 on the complaint of a public servant. The two offences are fundamentally distinct in nature, although they may arise out of one and the same statement of the accused. The defamatory statement does not fall within any of the Exception to section 499 by reason merely of the fact that it is punishable as an offence under section 182, or any other section of the Code; nor is this section included in the list of sections contained in section 195(1)(b) of the Cr PC, 1973.153. Where the imputations were against the managing director of a society, the society was held to be not an aggrieved person and, therefore, had no locus standi to file a complaint.154.\nA newspaper published extracts from books written on a former Prime Minister, imputing charges of corruption against him and also his family members including his sons, daughter and wife. It was held that his sons could be said to be aggrieved persons. A complaint filed by one of the sons was not to be quashed.155.\nThe continuation of the proceedings even after the death of the complainant has been held to be not proper.156. Where the allegation in the complaint was that the Kerala Police had been defamed, the Court said that Kerala Police was not a definite and determinable body and, therefore, a member of the Kerala Police was not a person affected by the defamatory statement and his complaint was not maintainable.157.\nWhen the statements in question are not directed against any person or against an identifiable group of individuals, the complainants cannot be said to be an aggrieved persons. The complainants have alleged defamation in respect of imputations against the character of Tamil-speaking women, which could be viewed as a class of persons. However, the appellant's remarks did not suggest that all women in Tamil Nadu have engaged in pre-marital sex. In fact her statement in News Magazine did not refer to any specific individual or group at all.158."

Where the utterances of the accused in a meeting were proved to harm the reputation of the complainant, his conviction under section 500 was held to be proper.168.\n\nFor the publication of defamatory matter in a newspaper the sentence awarded was that of imprisonment till the rising of the Court and fine of Rs. 500.

Ultimately, the Supreme Court quashed proceedings relating to prosecution of such a case in that reported decision by applying Exception 8 to section 499 of the IPC, 1860. Therefore, it cannot be said that application of exception cannot be considered at pre-trial stage and by invoking section 482 of the Cr PC, 1973.171. In Vedurumudi Rama Rao v Chennuri Venkat Rao,172. Court considered applicability of Exception 9 to section 499 of the IPC, 1860 and held that truth of imputation need not be probed by such accused while claiming privilege under Exception 9; and finally quashed proceedings in criminal case relating to the offence punishable under section 500 of the IPC, 1860. The Gujarat High Court in Darusing Durgasing v State of Gujarat,173. followed the above said reported decision of the Supreme Court and quashed criminal proceedings for the offence punishable under section 500 of the IPC, 1860 in view of Exceptions 7, 8 and 9 to section 499 of the IPC, 1860. In an examination fact situation, the Bombay High Court in Valmiki Faleiro v Mrs. Lauriana Fernandes,174. went to the extent of holding a paper publication containing certain imputations as one saved by Exception 9 because intention of the accused was predominantly to protect his rights in the property and not to harm reputation of the complainant. In Jeffrey J Diermeier v State of WB,175. it was pleaded that in the light of Explanation 4 as well as Tenth Exception to section 499 IPC, 1860, the allegations in the complaint did not constitute an offence of defamation punishable under section 500 IPC, 1860. But the Supreme Court held that the mere plea that the accused believed that what he had stated was in \"good faith\" is not sufficient to accept his defence and he must justify the same by adducing evidence. Court found it difficult to hold that a case for quashing of the complaint under section 482 of the Code has been made out."

Gauhati High Court examined the question whether a Magistrate can take cognizance of a non-cognizable offence punishable under section 500, IPC, 1860 on the basis of the police report submitted by the police under section 173(2), Cr PC, 1973 while investigating both a cognizable offence and a non-cognizable offence under section 155(4), Cr PC, 1973 even after the accused is discharged from the cognizable case. It is held that as one of the offences alleged against the petitioner was a cognizable offence, namely, section 505(2), IPC, 1860, by virtue of the legal fiction introduced in section 155(4), Cr PC, 1973, the case was deemed to be a cognizable offence. Once the case was deemed to be a cognizable offence, there was no legal impediment in investigating the case by the police. After the case was investigated by the police, the charge-sheet was submitted by them to the learned Magistrate under section 173, Cr PC, 1973 for trying the petitioner under section 505 (2)/500, IPC, 1860. However, the charge made against the petitioner under section 505(2), IPC, 1860 was quashed by this Court on the ground that no prosecution sanction under section 196 (1A), Cr PC, 1973 was obtained by the police. The net result is that the trial Court had to proceed with consideration of the charge under section 500, IPC, 1860 and, after hearing the parties, framed the charge accordingly by rejecting the prayer of the petitioner for dropping the charge against him.179.\nIn the defamation matter, issuance of process after having examination of defamatory material with reaction of the public, would certainly be sufficient to satisfy the test of holding the enquiry under Section 202, Cr PC, 1973.180."

Defamation has been defined under section 499 which provides inter alia whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.

A is guilty of criminal intimidation.\n\n\n\nbefore it can have any effect upon his mind it must be either made to him by the person threatening or communicated to him in some way. The threat referred to in this section must be a threat communicated or uttered with the intention of its being communicated to the person threatened for the purpose of influencing his mind.3. The threat must be one which can be put into execution by the person threatening. It is not necessary that the injury should be one to be inflicted by the offender; it is sufficient if he can cause it to be inflicted by another; and the infliction of it could be avoided by some act or omission that the person threatening desires. Punishment by God is not one which a person could cause to be inflicted or the execution of which he could avoid.4.\n\nA threat, in order to be indictable, must be made with intent to cause alarm to the complainant. Mere vague allegation by the accused that he is going to take revenge by false complaints cannot amount to criminal intimidation.5."

      "title": "Intentional insult with intent to provoke breach of the peace.",
      "content": "Whoever intentionally insults, and thereby gives provocation to any person, intending or knowing it to be likely that such provocation will cause him to break the public peace, or to commit any other offence, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both.\n\n\n\nCOMMENT.—\n\nThis section provides a remedy for using abusive and insulting language. Abusive language which may lead to a breach of the public peace is not an offence. There must be an intentional insult. Insult may be offered by words or conduct. If it is by words, the words must amount to something more than mere vulgar abuse.10. Mere breach of good manners does not constitute an offence under this section.11. If the insult is of such a nature that it may give provocation which might rouse a man to act either to break the public peace or to commit any other offence, the offence is committed.12.\nIn judging whether a particular abusive language comes within the mischief of section 504, Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860), the Court has to see what would be the effect of the language used in ordinary course of events and not how the complainant actually behaved on being abused. Merely because a man of cool temperament did not react violently or break the peace it does not follow that no offence was committed by the accused.13. In the absence of actual words used by the accused or even a gist of it in the complaint it is not possible to say if the case falls within the ambit of section 504 (IPC, 1960), and as such the charge has to be quashed.14. Thus where the only allegation in the complaint was that when the complainant resisted the attempts by the accused to evict her forcibly from the land in her tenancy, the accused persons abused her in filthy words, the complainant not disclosing the actual words used by the accused or that she was provoked by the insulting abuse, the accused were not summoned.15."

Of course, offences under this section and sections 506 and 507, (IPC, 1860), can be made cognizable offences in specified areas by the State Government by a notification in the official Gazette under section 10 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1932.\nA mere threat which causes no alarm to the complainant does not constitute an offence under the section.27."

It makes punishable all attempts to commit offences punishable with imprisonment and not only those punishable for life or death.3.\nA person commits the offence of 'attempt to commit a particular offence' when (i) he intends to commit that particular offence; and (ii) he, having made preparations and with the intention to commit the offence, does an act towards its commission; such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence, but must be an act during the course of committing that offence, section 511, IPC, 1860 is attracted.4. An attempt to commit an offence is an act, or a series of acts, which leads inevitably to the commission of the offence, unless something, which the doer of the\n\nact neither foresaw nor intended, happens to prevent this. An attempt may be described to be an act done in part execution of a criminal design, amounting to more than mere preparation, but falling short of actual consummation, and, possessing, except for failure to consummate, all the elements of the substantive crime. In other words, an attempt consists in it the intent to commit a crime, falling short of, its actual commission or consummation/completion. It may consequently be defined as that which if not prevented would have resulted in the full consummation of the act attempted. The illustrations given in section 511 clearly show the legislative intention to make a difference between the cases of a mere preparation and an attempt.5.\n\nIn Om Prakash's case6. the Supreme Court has clearly held that like section 511, IPC, 1860 in section 307, IPC, 1860 to the act need not be the penultimate act."

      "title": "Essentials.—",
      "content": "In every crime, there is first intention to commit it; second, preparation to commit it; third, attempt to commit it. If the third stage, that is attempt is successful, then the crime is complete. If the attempt fails, the crime is not complete but the law punishes the person attempting the act. An 'attempt' is made punishable, because every attempt, although it fails of success, must create alarm, which, of itself, is an injury, and the moral guilt of the offender is the same as if he had succeeded.\nA culprit first intends to commit the offence, then makes preparation for committing it and thereafter attempts to commit the offence. If the attempt succeeds, he has committed the offence, if it fails due to reasons beyond his control, he is said to have attempted to commit the offence. Attempt to commit an offence can be said to begin when the preparations are complete and the culprit commences to do something with the intention of committing the offence and which is a step towards the commission of the offence. The moment he commences to do an act with the necessary intention, he commences his attempt to commit the offence—the act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of the offence but it must be an act during the course of committing that offence.7.\n(1) Intention.—Intention is the direction of conduct towards the object chosen upon considering the motives which suggest the choice.8. The will is not to be taken for the deed, unless there be some external act which shows that progress has been made in the direction of it, or towards maturing and affecting it. In an attempt to commit an offence, there must be intention to commit the crime combined with doing of some act adopted to, but falling short of its actual commission.9.\n\n(2) Preparation.—Preparation consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission of an offence.10."

It was held that she could not be convicted of an attempt to commit suicide as she might have changed her mind before jumping into the well.12.\n(3) Attempt.—Attempt is the direct movement towards the commission after the preparations are made.13. In State of Maharashtra v Mohd. Yakub,14. reported in the Apex Court considered the definition of 'attempt to commit crime' as the last proximate act which a person does towards the commission of an offence, the consummation of the offence being hindered by circumstances beyond his control. It was observed by the Apex Court that what constitutes an \"attempt\" is a mixed question of law and fact, depending largely on the circumstances of the particular case. \"Attempt\" defies a precise and exact definition. Broadly speaking, all crimes which consist of the commission of affirmative acts are preceded by some covert or overt conduct which may be divided into three stages. The first stage exists when the culprit first entertains the idea or intention to commit an offence. In the second stage, he makes preparations to commit it. The third stage is reached when the culprit takes deliberate overt steps to commit the offence. Such overt act or step in order to be 'criminal' need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of the offence. It is sufficient if such act or acts were deliberately done, and manifest a clear intention to commit the offence aimed, being reasonably proximate to the consummation of the offence.\nThe test for determining whether the acts constitute attempt or preparation is whether the overt acts already done are such that if the offender changes his mind and does not proceed further in its progress, the acts already done would be completely harmless. But where the thing done is such as, if not prevented by any extraneous cause, would fructify into commission of an offence, it would amount to an attempt to commit that offence.15. An attempt to commit an offence does not cease to be an attempt merely because after the attempt is made and before the actual completion of the offence the offender may be able to prevent its completion by doing some other act in pursuance of a changed intention.16.\n\nAn accused is liable for attempt where his failure to commit an offence is not due to any act or omission of his own, but to the intervention of some factor independent of his own volition.17. Where misrepresentations had been made and money obtained from the persons sought to be cheated by misrepresentations, there is an attempt to cheat and not merely a preparation for committing that offence.18."

      "title": "Distinction between 'preparation' and 'attempt'.—",

A person commits the offence of attempt to commit a particular offence when accused (i) intends to commit a particular offence, (ii) he having made preparation and with the intention to commit an offence, (iii) does an act towards its commission, such an act need not be the penultimate act towards the commission of that offence but must be an act during the course of committing that offence.19.\n1. 'Offence punishable by this Code'.—No criminal liability can be incurred under the Code by an attempt to do an act, which if done will not be an offence against the Code.20.\nThe expression \"whoever attempts to commit an offence\" in this section can only mean \"whoever intends to do a certain act with the intent or knowledge necessary for the commission of that offence\".21."
    },
    "section511.5": {
      "title": "Impossible offence.—",
      "content": "An attempt is possible, even when the offence attempted cannot be committed; as when a person, intending to pick another person's pocket, thrusts his hand into the pocket, but finds it empty. That such an act would amount to a criminal attempt appears from the illustrations to this section. But in doing such an act, the offender's intention is to commit a complete offence, and his act only falls short of the offence by reason of an accidental circumstance which has prevented the completion of the offence. It is possible to attempt to commit an impossible theft and so offend against the Code because theft is itself an offence against the Code, and may therefore, be attempted within the meaning of the Code. At the same time it is necessary to show that the means adopted are apparently suitable for the fulfilment of the design.22. Thus where a man threatens the life of another with a child's pop gun using a cork as a projectile23. or tries to pick the pocket of a man who is well beyond the reach of his hand, no attempt either to commit murder or to steal can be said to have been committed as the means adopted are impossible of achieving the designed purpose. Similar would be the case in regard to absolutely impossible acts. Thus where the act is such that it is incapable of commission, e.g., trying to steal from an empty room or an empty pocket or trying to kill a person by shooting at a bulge in a bed thinking it to be the enemy, no criminal attempt can be said to have been committed.24. In the IPC, 1860, however, trying to steal from an empty pocket would still constitute an attempt as Illustration (b) to section 511, IPC, 1860 specifically says so. Though in England too this happened to be the law previously25. the position has materially changed after the decision of the House of Lords in Haughtons case.26. It is felt that the law in India should be changed on this score at least to bring about a uniformity of approach to this question of attempt so far sections 307 and 511, IPC, 1860 are concerned especially, after the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Om Prakash's case,27. has held that under both these sections the act need not be the last proximate act."

The University authorities gave the accused permission to appear at the examination. Later on, finding that the certificates were false and that the accused was not a graduate and was not a teacher, the University authorities withdrew the permission. The Supreme Court held that the accused was guilty of attempting to cheat and that the moment the accused dispatched his application to the University, he entered the realm of attempting to commit the offence of cheating.28. Where the accused made an alteration in his own affidavit under the honest belief that it was necessary for customs' clearance, the Supreme Court set aside the conviction under section 420 read with this section.29.\nThe offence of attempting to cheat may be committed even though the person attempted to be cheated does not believe in the representations made to him and is not misled by them but only feigns belief in order to trap the offender.30."

For an offence of attempt to commit rape, prosecution is required to establish that the act of the accused went beyond the stage of preparation.

Its basis is the law of England freed from superfluities, technicalities and local peculiarities. Suggestions were also derived from the French Penal Code and from Livingstone's Code of Louisiana. The draft underwent a very careful revision at the hands of Sir Barnes Peacock, Chief Justice, and puisne Judges of the Calcutta Supreme Court who were members of the Legislative Council, and was passed into law in 1860. Though it is principally the work of a man who had hardly held a brief, and whose time was devoted to politics and literature, yet it is universally acknowledged to be a monument of codification and an everlasting memorial to the high juristic attainments of its distinguished author.\n\nObjects of penal legislation.\n\nThe legitimate objects of penal legislation are the selection of those violations of right which are sufficiently dangerous to the good order of society to justify and require the infliction of punishment to repress them, and the adaptation of the degree of punishment to the purpose of repressing such violations.\n\n\n\nCrime.\n\nA crime is an act of commission or omission, contrary to municipal law, tending to the prejudice of the community, for which punishment can be inflicted as the result of judicial proceedings taken in the name of the State. It tends directly to the prejudice of the community, while a civil injury tends more directly and immediately to the prejudice of a private right. The true test between a crime and a civil injury is that the latter is compensated by damages, while the former is punished. The State is supposed to be injured by any wrong to the community and is, therefore, the proper prosecutor. Many crimes include a tort or civil injury; but every tort does not amount to a crime, nor does every crime include a tort. Conspiracy, conversion, private nuisance, wrongful distress, etc., are merely torts. Assault, false imprisonment, false charge, defamation, etc., are all crimes as well as torts. Forgery, perjury, bigamy, homicide, etc., are crimes but not torts.\nThe great difference between the legal and the popular meanings of the word crime is that whereas the only perfectly definite meaning which a lawyer can attach to the word is that of an act or omission punishable by law, the popular or moral conception adds to this the notion of moral guilt of a specially deep and degrading kind. By a criminal, people in general understand a person who is liable to be punished, because he has done something at once wicked and obviously injurious in a high degree to the common interest of society. Criminal law is, however, confined within very narrow limits and can be applied only to definite overt acts or omissions capable of being distinctly proved, which acts or omissions inflict definite evils, either on specific persons or on the community at large.1.\nBy criminal law is now understood the law as to the definition, trial and punishment of crimes, i.e., of acts or omissions forbidden by law which affect injuriously public rights, or constitute a breach of duties due to the whole community. Criminal law includes the\n\nrules as to the prevention, investigation, prosecution and punishment of crimes. It lays down what constitutes an offence, what proof is necessary to prove it, what procedure should be followed in a court, and what punishment should be imposed.\nIn criminal law the general principle is that there must be some guilty condition of mind in every offence. This is designated by the expression mens rea. It is however in the power of the Legislature to enact that a man may be convicted of an offence although there was no guilty mind. Where a statute requires a mental state to be proved as an essential element of a crime, the burden is on the prosecution to prove it. The absence of mens rea really consists in an honest and reasonable belief entertained by the accused of the existence of facts, which, if true, would make the act charged against him innocent.\nThe authors of the Code observe:—\"We cannot admit that a Penal Code is by any means to be considered as a body of ethics, that the Legislature ought to punish acts merely because those acts are immoral, or that, because an act is not punished at all, it follows that the Legislature considers that act as innocent. Many things which are not punishable are morally worse than many things which are punishable. The man who treats a generous benefactor with gross ingratitude and insolence deserves more severe reprehension than the man who aims a blow in a passion, or breaks a window in a frolic; yet we have punishments for assault and mischief, and none for ingratitude. The rich man who refuses a mouthful of rice to save a fellow-creature from death may be a far worse man than the starving wretch who snatches and devours the rice; yet we punish the latter for theft, and we do not punish the former for hard-heartedness.\"2.\nCriminal law forms generally a part of the public law not variable in any one of its parts by the volition of private individuals and it is not necessarily deprived of its effect merely by the possible culpability of the individuals who may be the sufferers by the breach. The maxim ex turpicausa non orituractio is not a sufficient excuse for a man who acts in opposition to the provisions of a penal statute. If a man, for instance, gives a spurious sovereign to a person for losing a bet, and the latter sues the former, he cannot succeed for a breach of contract.\n\n\n\nPresumption of innocence.\n\nIn criminal cases the presumption of law is that the accused is innocent. The burden of proving every fact essential to bring the charge home to the accused lies on the prosecution. The evidence must be such as to exclude every reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. The evidence of guilt must not be a mere balance of probabilities, but must satisfy the Court beyond all shadow of reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty. In matters of doubt it is safer to acquit than to condemn, since it is better that several guilty persons should escape than one innocent person suffer. Unbiased moral conviction is no sufficient foundation for a verdict of guilty, unless it is based on substantial facts leading to no other reasonable conclusion than that of guilt of the accused. No man can be convicted of an offence where the theory of his guilt is no more likely than the theory of his innocence.\nUnder section 105 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, it is incumbent on the accused to prove the existence of circumstances (if any) which bring the offence charged within any exception or proviso contained in the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC, 1860), and the court shall presume the absence of such circumstances. But if it is apparent from the evidence on record whether produced by the prosecution or defence, that a general exception would apply, then the presumption is removed and it is duty of the court to consider whether the evidence proves to the satisfaction of the court that the accused comes within the exception.\n\nLimitation.\n\nPreviously there was no limitation to prosecute a person for an offence as \"Nullum tempus occuritregi\" (lapse of time does not bar the right of the Crown) was the rule. And as a criminal trial was regarded as an action by the government, it could be brought at any time. It would be odious and fatal, says Bentham, to allow wickedness, after a certain time, to triumph over innocence. No treaty should be made with malefactors of that character. Let the avenging sword remain always hanging over their heads. The sight of a criminal in peaceful enjoyment of the fruit of his crimes, protected by the laws he has violated, is a consolation to evil-doers, an object of grief to men of virtue, a public insult to justice and to morals. The Roman law, however, laid down a prescription of 20 years for criminal offences as a rule. There is no period of limitation for offences which fall within the four corners of IPC.\nAn entire Chapter captioned \"Limitation For Taking Cognizance of Certain Offences\" (Chapter XXXVI) has been added to the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 (Cr PC, 1973) to prevent taking of cognizance after certain periods in offences not punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding three years. Thus, section 468 of Cr PC, 1973 lays down:\n\n(1) Except as otherwise provided elsewhere in this Code no Court shall take cognizance of an offence of the category specified in sub-section (2), after the expiry of the period of limitation.\n(2) The period of limitation shall be—\n(a) six months, if the offence is punishable with fine only;\n(b) one year, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year;\n(c) Three years, if the offence is punishable with imprisonment for a term exceeding one year but not exceeding three years.\n(3) ********\n\nA Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court in Mrs. Sarah Mathew v The Institute of Cardio Vascular Diseases,3. held that the period of Limitation starts from the date of Complaint, not from date of Cognizance.\nAs opposed to the Benthamian concept of no limitation to criminal prosecutions, the modern concept is that the accused shall not be kept under a perpetual threat for any length of time and right to have a speedy trial should be regarded as one of his basic human rights. In keeping with this spirit the new Criminal Procedure Code has further made provisions in sub-section (5) of section 167, Cr PC, 1973, for the stoppage of investigation in Summons Cases, if the investigation is not concluded within six months from the date on which the accused was arrested.\n\n\n\nMaster's liability for servant's act.\n\nThe master is liable for the tortious acts of his servants done in the course of his employment and for the master's benefit, but in criminal law he who does the act is liable except where a person who is not the doer, abets or authorizes the act. There are, however, certain exceptions to this principle.\n1. Statutory liability.—A statute may impose criminal liability upon the master as regards the acts or omission of his servants. Licence cases form a class by themselves in\n\nwhich the master is generally held responsible.\n\n2. Public nuisance.—The owner of works carried on for his profit by his agents is liable to be indicted for a public nuisance caused by acts of his agents in carrying on the works.\n3. Neglect of duty.—If a person neglects the performance of an act which is likely to cause danger to others, and entrusts it to unskilful hands he will in certain cases be criminally liable.\n1. Vicarious liability.—Indian Penal Code, 1860, save and except some matters does not contemplate any vicarious liability on the part a person. (Exceptions to this rule include section 34, 149, etc.)\n2. Corporate Criminal Liability.—A company is liable to be prosecuted and punished for criminal offences. Although there are earlier authorities to the fact that the corporation cannot commit a crime, the generally accepted modern rule is that a corporation may be subject to indictment and other criminal process although the criminal act may be committed through its agent. The majority in the Constitution bench held that there is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the punishment is mandatory imprisonment and fine. The corporations can no longer claim immunity from criminal prosecution on the ground that they are incapable of possessing the necessary mens rea for the commission of criminal offences.4.\n\n\n\nScheme.\n\nThe following tabular statement gives an outline of the scheme of IPC, 1860.—\n\nGeneral Provisions\n\n1. Territorial operation of the Code (c. I).\n2. General Explanations (c. II).\n3. Punishments (c. III).\n4. General Exceptions (c. IV).\n5. Abetment (c. V).\n6. Conspiracy (c. VA).\n7. Attempts (c.

Affecting reputation\tIntimidation, insult and annoyance (c. XXII).\n\n\n\nDate and extent of operation. Chapter 1.\n\nThe IPC, 1860, came into operation on 1 January 1862. It takes effect throughout India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. For every act or omission contrary to the provisions of the Code a person is liable to punishment under it (sections 1 and 2). Every person is made liable to punishment under the Code without distinction of nation or rank. A foreigner, who enters the Indian territories and accepts the protection of Indian laws, virtually submits himself to their operation. The Penal Code does not exempt anyone from the jurisdiction of criminal Courts, but the following are exceptions to this principle:—\n\n(1) The Sovereign.\n(2) Foreign Sovereigns.\n\n(3) Ambassadors.\n(4) Alien enemies\n(5) Foreign army.\n(6) Men-of-war.\n\nThe courts in India are prohibited from issuing a process against the President of India or the Governor of a State. (Article 361 of Constitution)\n\n\n\nTerritorial jurisdiction.\n\nThe territorial jurisdiction of criminal courts will extend into the sea as far as 12 nautical miles.\nLeading case:—R v Kastya Rama\n\n\n\nExtra-territorial operation.\n\nAn offence committed outside India may, however, be tried as an offence committed in\nIndia under the following circumstances:—\n\n1. By virtue of any Indian law (section 3).\n\n2. When such offence is committed by\n\n(1) any citizen of India in any place without and beyond India,\n\n(2) any person on any ship or aircraft registered in India wherever it may be (section 4).\n\nWhere an offence is committed beyond the limits of India but the offender is found\nwithin its limits he may be (I) extradited; or (II) tried in India.\n\n\n\nExtradition.\n\n(I) Extradition is the surrender by one State to another of a person desired to be dealt with for crimes of which he has been accused or convicted and which are justiciable in the courts of the other State. Whether an offender should be handed over pursuant to a requisition is determined by the domestic law of the State on which requisition is made. In India, the procedure is to be found laid down in the Extradition Act, 1962.5.\n\n\n\nIntra-territorial trial.\n\n(II) The Courts in India are empowered to try offences committed out of India either on\n(A) Land or (B) High Seas or (C) Aircraft.\n\n\n\nLand.\n\n(A) By virtue of sections 3 and 4 of IPC, 1860, and section 188 of Cr PC, 1973, local courts can try offences committed outside India.\nWhen the consequence of an act committed by a foreigner outside India if ensued in India, he can be tried in India.6.\n\n\n\nHigh seas: Admiralty Jurisdiction.\n\n(B) The jurisdiction to try offences committed on the high seas is known as Admiralty jurisdiction. It is founded on the principle that a ship on the high seas is a floating island belonging to the nation whose flag she is flying.\nThe jurisdiction extends over—\n\n(1) Offences committed on Indian ships. Such offences may be committed:\n(a) on the high seas or in rivers, below the bridges, where the tide ebbs and flows, and where great ships go; or\n(b) at a spot where the municipal authorities of a foreign country might exercise concurrent jurisdiction.\n(2) Offences committed on foreign ships in Indian territorial waters.\n(3) Pirates.\n\nSection 18 of IPC, 1860, defines India as the territory of India excluding the state of Jammu and Kashmir. These territorial limits would include the territorial waters of India.7. By The Territorial Waters, Continental Shelf, Exclusive Economic Zone and Other Maritime Zones Act 80 of 1976, extend of India's Territorial waters was statutorily fixed at 12 nautical miles.\nAll the High Courts in India have inherent admiralty jurisdiction and can invoke the same for the enforcement of a maritime claim.8. Admiralty jurisdiction was vested in the mofussil courts by 12 & 13 Vic. c. 96, and section 686 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958. The investigation/enquiry under Part XII of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1958, cannot be held to be a substitute for a proper investigation into an alleged crime if the same has been committed.\n\n\n\nAircraft.\n\n(C) The provisions of IPC, 1860, are made applicable to any offence committed by any person on any aircraft registered in India, wherever it may be.\nIndian courts cannot try foreigners who are in India for offences committed by them outside India.\n\n\n\nLaws not affected by the Code.\n\nThe IPC, 1860, does not affect the provisions of (1) any act for punishing mutiny and desertion by officers, soldiers, sailors or airmen, in the service of the Government of India;\n\n(2) any special or local law (section 5).\n\nAn offence expressly made punishable by a special or local law will be punishable under the Code. But if the Legislature in framing the special or local law intended to exclude the operation of the Code, no prosecution under the Code would lie. However, a person cannot be punished both under the Code and the special law for the same offence.\n\n\n\nGeneral Explanations. Chapter II.\n\nIn chapter II, the leading terms used in the Code are defined and explained and the meanings, thus, announced are steadily adhered to throughout the subsequent chapters.\nGeneral exceptions are part of the definition of every offence contained in IPC, 1860,\nsection 6, but the burden to prove their existence lies on the accused.\n\nThe Supreme Court has explained some of the categories of \"public servants\" (section 21).\nThe definition is not exhaustive. A person may be a public servant under some other statute. Naresh Kumar Madan v State of MP, Leader of opposition in the Assembly is not a public servant. Sushil Modi v Mohan Guruswamy.\nLeading cases:—K Veeraswami v UOI Lakshmiman Singh v Naresh Ashok Marketing Ltd v PNB.\nImitation of foreign currency is an offence within the meaning of \"counterfeit\" (section 28).\nLeading case:—State of Kerala v Mathai Verghese\n\nAn act includes an illegal omission save where the contrary appears from the context. Where the causing of an effect in an offence if it is caused either by an act or by an omission, the causing of that effect partly by an act and partly by an omission is the same offence (section 36). When an offence is committed by several persons committing different acts, each person intentionally committing one of those acts, either singly or jointly with others, commits the offence (section 37).\n\n\n\nJoint offenders.\n\nWhere a criminal act is committed jointly by several persons the following principles will apply:—\n1. When the act is done in furtherance of the common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for it in the same manner as if it were done by him alone (section 34).\nMere presence does not create a presumption of complicity. A person not cognizant of the intention of his companion to commit murder is not liable for murder, though he has joined his companion to do an unlawful act. There must be (i) a pre-arranged plan or a preconcert and (ii) in offences involving physical violence participation if section 34 is to apply; both these factors must be established against the accused before he can be held liable under the section. Common intention or meeting of minds to bring about a particular result may well develop on the spot itself as between a number of persons. Joint responsibility was inflicted upon the sub-inspector (SI) in charge of a\n\npolice station where two police constables beat a person to death, though the SI himself had done no beating. Amar Singh v HP. It is not necessary that all must come together. State of MP v Mansingh. The Supreme Court examined the effect of mere presence at the place of occurrence. State of UP v Sohruntia.\nLeading cases:—Barendra Kumar Ghose v Mahbub Shah; Hari Om v State of UP; Suresh v State of UP.\nThe Supreme Court has reiterated that there could rarely be direct evidence of common intention. Jhinku Nai.\n2. When the act is only criminal by reason of its being done with a criminal knowledge or intention, each is liable only to the extent of his own knowledge or intention (section 35).\nA person assisting the accused who actually performs the act must be shown to have the particular intent or knowledge. If an act which is an offence, without reference to any criminal knowledge or intention on the part of the doer, is done by several persons, each of them is liable for the offence.\n3. Where several persons are engaged or concerned in the commission of a criminal act, they may be guilty of different offences by means of that act (section 38). Yunus v State, 1995 Cr LJ 3205 (Del), where common intention was found only up to the stage of causing hurt, though the end result of the crime was murder.\nSection 34 deals with acts done with a common intention, section 38, with acts done with different intentions.\nAn act done under compulsions of survival, such as putting up huts on public- footpaths, cannot be regarded as voluntary. (section 39)\nLeading case:—Olga Tellis v Bombay MC\n\n\n\nPunishment. Chapter III.\n\nThe punishments to which offenders are liable are:—\n\n1. Death.\n2. Imprisonment for life.\n3. Imprisonment :\n(i) Rigorous (i.e., with hard labour);\n(ii) Simple;\n(iii) Solitary.\n4. Forfeiture of property.\n5. Fine (section 63).\n\nImposition of proper and appropriate sentence is a bounded obligation and duty of the court. The endeavour of the court must be to ensure that the accused received appropriate sentence. The sentence must be accorded to the gravity of the offence (section 53) Gurumukh Singh v State of Haryana, AIR 2009 SC 2697 [LNIND 2009 SC\n\n847] . The Supreme Court explained guidelines for sentencing policy in State of MP v Babu Nath, AIR 2009 SC 1810 [LNIND 2008 SC 2471] .\nLabour taken from prisoners must not be of obnoxious nature and payment must not be less than the applicable minimum wage. Gurdev v HP, 1992 Cr LJ 2542 (HP).\nIn addition to these there is punishment of detention in reformatories or Borstal Schools in the case of juvenile offenders (Act VIII of 1897 and other local Acts).\n\n\n\nDeath.\n\n1. Sentence of death may be commuted without the consent of the offender by the appropriate Government for any other punishment (section 54). The punishment of death may be awarded in the following cases:—\n(1) Waging war against the Government of India (section 121).\n\n(2) Abetting mutiny actually committed (section 132).\n\n(3) Giving or fabricating false evidence upon which an innocent person suffers death (section 194).\n(4) Murder (section 302).\n\nCapital punishment should be confined to rarest of rare cases.\n\nLeading cases:—Bachan Singh. Machhi Singh. Munwar Harun Shah. Triveniben v State of Gujarat Madhu Mehta v UOI.\nSwamy Shraddananda (2) v State of Karnataka; Santosh Kumar Bariyar v State\n\n(5) Abetment of suicide of a minor, or an insane or an intoxicated person (section 305).\n\n(6) Attempt to murder by a person under sentence of imprisonment for life, if hurt is caused (section 307).\n(7) Dacoity accompanied with murder (section 396).\n\nSentence of death may be awarded where a person who is under sentence of imprisonment for life commits murder (section 302).\nSection 303 has been struck down by the Supreme Court as void and unconstitutional being violative of both Articles 14 and 21 of the Constitution. R Rathinam v UOI. This decision was subsequently reversed in Gain Kaur v State of Punjab.\nLeading cases:—Mithu. Bhagwan Bax Singh.\n\nCausing death in custody by third degree methods should merit deterrent punishment.\n\nLeading case:—Gauri Shanker Sharma v State of UP.\n\n\n\nImprisonment for life.\n\n2. The appropriate Government may commute, without the consent of the offender, a sentence of imprisonment for life to imprisonment not exceeding 14 years (section 55).\n\nIn calculating fractions, imprisonment for life is reckoned as equivalent to 20 years (section 57).\nLeading case:—Gopal Vinayak Godse v State of Maharashtra.\n\nImprisonment for life must be inflicted for being a 'thug' (section 311).\n\n\n\nImprisonment.\n\n3. In every case in which sentence of imprisonment for life shall have been passed, the appropriate government may, without the consent of the offender, commute the punishment for imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding 14 years (section 55);\nThe lowest term of imprisonment actually named for a given offence, viz., misconduct by a drunken person, is 24 hours (section 510); but the minimum is unlimited except in two cases:—\n(1) If at the time of committing robbery or dacoity the offender uses a deadly weapon or causes grievous hurt, or\n(2) If while committing this offence he is armed with a deadly weapon, he is punished with imprisonment for not less than seven years (sections 397 and 398).\nSentence of imprisonment may be, in certain cases, wholly or partly rigorous or simple (section 60). But in two cases the imprisonment must be rigorous:—\n(1) Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction for a capital offence (section 194).\n(2) House-trespass to commit an offence punishable with death (section 449).\n\nThere are 12 offences that are punishable with simple imprisonment only.\n\nThe courts are expected to properly operate the sentencing system. The court should impose such sentence for proved offences as will serve as a deterrent for their commission by others. The socio-economic status, prestige, race, caste of the accused or victim are irrelevant considerations in the policy of sentencing. State of Karnataka v Krishnappa (section 53).\n\n\n\nSolitary confinement.\n\nSolitary confinement may be inflicted for offences punishable with rigorous imprisonment. The offender may be kept in solitary confinement for any portion or portions of his term of imprisonment, not exceeding three months in the whole. But the solitary confinement must not exceed—\none month, if the term of imprisonment does not exceed six months;\n\ntwo months, if the term of imprisonment exceeds six months but does not exceed one year;\nthree months, if the term of imprisonment exceeds one year (section 73).\n\nIn executing a sentence of solitary confinement, such confinement must not exceed 14 days at a time, with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such period; and when the imprisonment awarded exceeds three months, the solitary confinement must not exceed seven days in any one month of the whole imprisonment awarded with intervals between the periods of solitary confinement of not less duration than such period (section 74).\nA sentence of solitary confinement for more than three months cannot be passed even if a person is convicted at one trial of more than one offence. Such confinement is awarded for offences under the Code only. Even then it cannot be awarded where imprisonment is not part of the sentence or where the imprisonment is in lieu of fine. It may be awarded in a summary trial. Solitary confinement must be imposed at intervals. A sentence inflicting solitary confinement for the whole imprisonment is illegal, though not more than 14 days are awarded.\n\n\n\nForfeiture.\n\n4. The punishment of forfeiture of the property of the offender has been abolished except in the following cases:—\n(1) Where a person commits depredation on the territories of any power at peace with the Government of India, he is liable, in addition to other punishments, to forfeiture of any property used, or intended to be used, in committing such depredation, or acquired thereby (section 126).\n(2) Where a person receives property taken as above mentioned or in waging war against any Asiatic Power at peace with the Government of India, he is liable to forfeit such property (section 127).\n(3) A public servant, who improperly purchases property, which, by virtue of his office, he is legally prohibited from purchasing, forfeits such property (section 169).\n5. Fine is awarded as a sentence by itself in the following cases:—\n\n\n\nFine.\n\n(1) A person, in charge of a merchant vessel, negligently allowing a deserter from the Army, Navy or Air Force to obtain concealment in such vessels is liable to a fine not exceeding Rs. 500 (section 137).\n(2) The owner or occupier of land, on which a riot takes place or an unlawful assembly is held, and any person having or claiming any interest in such land, and not using all lawful means to prevent such riot or unlawful assembly, is punishable with fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000 (section 154).\n(3) The person for whose benefit a riot has been committed not having duly endeavoured to prevent it (section 155).\n(4) The agent or manager of such person under like circumstances (section 156).\n\n(5) Illegal payments in connection with an election (section 171-H).\n\n(6) Failure to keep election accounts (section 171-I).\n\n(7) Voluntarily vitiating the atmosphere so as to render it noxious to the public health is punishable with fine of Rs. 500 (section 278).\n(8) Obstructing a public way or line of navigation is punishable with fine not exceeding Rs. 200 (section 283).\n(9) Committing of public nuisance not otherwise punishable is punishable with fine not exceeding Rs. 200 (section 290).\n(10) Whoever publishes any proposal to pay any sum, or to deliver any goods, or to do or forbear from doing anything for the benefit of any person, on any event or contingency relative or applicable to the drawing of a ticket, lot, number, or figure, in any such lottery, not being a State lottery or a lottery authorised by the State Government, is punished with fine not exceeding Rs. 1,000 (section 294A).\nThe general principal of law running through sections 63–70 is that the amount of fine should not be harsh or excessive. Shantilal v State of MP, (2007) 11 SCC 243 [LNIND 2007 SC 1171] .\n\n\n\nImprisonment in default of fine.\n\nThe following provisions regulate the character and duration of the sentence of imprisonment in default of payment of fine:—\nWhere an offender is sentenced to a fine, the court may direct that the offender shall in default of payment suffer a term of imprisonment, which imprisonment may be in excess of any other imprisonment to which he may have been sentenced for the offence, or to which he may be liable under a commutation of sentence (section 64).\nIf the offence be punishable with imprisonment as well as fine such imprisonment must not exceed one-fourth of the term of imprisonment which is the maximum fixed for the offence (section 65); such extra imprisonment may be of any description to which the offender might have been sentenced for the offence (section 66).\nLeading case:—Ramjas v State of UP.\n\nIf such imprisonment is within the prescribed limits, it is not to be added to the substantive punishment.\nLeading case:—P Balaraman v State of TN.\n\nWhen the offence is punishable with fine only such imprisonment must not exceed two months when the amount of the fine does not exceed Rs. 50;\nfour months when the amount does not exceed Rs. 100, and for any term not exceeding six months in any other case (section 67). The imprisonment in such cases must be simple only.\nSuch imprisonment terminates—\n\n(1) upon payment of the fine (section 68); or\n\n(2) before the expiration of the term of imprisonment fixed in default of payment, if such a proportion of the fine be paid, or levied, that the term of imprisonment suffered\n\nin default of payment is not less than proportional to the part of the fine still unpaid (section 69).\nFine may be levied within six years, or at any time during the term of imprisonment if it be longer than six years; the death of the offender does not discharge from the liability any property which would, after his death, be legally liable for his debts (section 70). The limitation starts from the date of sentence of conviction by the trial Court: Palakdhari Singh.\nAn offender who has undergone full term of imprisonment inflicted in default of payment of fine is still liable for the amount of fine. The Bombay High Court has laid down that movable property of the offender can alone be distrained and sold for the recovery of fine. But the Calcutta High Court has held that a suit can be brought to recover fine by the sale of immovable property of the offender.\nThe Government may commute a sentence of\n\n\n\nCommutation of sentence.\n\n(1) death, for any other punishment;\n\n(2) imprisonment for life, for imprisonment for not more than 14 years (sections 54, 55).\nThe Government may commute without the offender's consent sentence in cases of\ndeath and imprisonment for life.\n\n\n\nLimit of punishment of offence made up of several offences.\n\n(1) Where an offence is made up of parts, each of which constitutes an offence, the offender is not punished for more than one offence unless expressly provided.\n(2) Where an offence falls within two or more separate definitions of offences; or where several acts of which one or more than one would, by itself or themselves, constitute an offence, constitute when combined a different offence, the offender is not punished with a more severe punishment than the court which tries him could award for any one of such offences (section 71).\nLeading cases:—Roshan Lal; Puranmal.\n\nThe results of combination of section 220, Cr PC, 1973, with this section have been enumerated at p 48.\n\n\n\nDoubt as to nature of offence.\n\nWhere it is doubtful as to of which of the several offences a person is guilty, he is punished for the offence for which the lowest imprisonment is provided (section 72).\n\n\n\nPrevious conviction.\n\nA person convicted by a Court in India of any offence\n\n(a) relating to Coin and Government Stamps (Chapter XII), or\n(b) against property (Chapter XVII)\n\npunishable with imprisonment for a term of three years or upwards shall be subject to imprisonment for life, or to imprisonment for 10 years, if he is again guilty of any offence punishable under either of those Chapters with like imprisonment for the like term (section 75).\nThe offender is subject to increased punishment on the ground that the punishment undergone has had no effect in preventing a repetition of the crime. The subsequent offence must also be punishable with not less than three years' imprisonment. If the subsequent offence is committed by a person previously to his being convicted of the first offence he cannot be subjected to enhanced punishment. Attempts not specifically made offences within Chapters XII and XVII are not governed by this provision. The previous conviction of an accused for an offence under these Chapters cannot be taken into consideration at a subsequent conviction for abetment of an offence under those Chapters.\n3. Overlapping provisions.—The fact of overlapping provisions about one or more offence, does not rule out trial under any one of them. The case did not fall within the Custom Act, 1962. It could not prevent trial under applicable provision of IPC, 1860. M Natarajan v State, (2008) 8 SCC 413 [LNIND 2008 SC 1093] .\n\n\n\nGeneral Exceptions. Chapter IV.\n\nThe following acts are not offence under the Code:—\n\n1. Act of a person bound by law to do a certain thing (section 76).\n\n2. Act of a Judge acting judicially (section 77).\n\n3. Act done pursuant to an order or a judgment of a court (section 78).\n\n4. Act of a person justified, or believing himself justified, by law (section 79).\n\n5. Act caused by accident (section 80).\n\n6. Act likely to cause harm done without criminal intent to prevent other harm (section 81).\n7. Act of a child under seven years (section 82).\n\n8. Act of a child above seven and under 12 years but of immature understanding (section 83).\n9. Act of a person of unsound mind (section 84).\n\n10. Act of an intoxicated person (section 85).\n\n11. Act not known to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt done by consent of the sufferer (section 87).\n12. Act not intended to cause death done by consent of the sufferer (section 88).\n\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a child or an insane person or by the consent of the guardian (section 89).\n14. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person without consent (section 92).\n\n15. Communication made in good faith to a person for his benefit (section 93).\n\n16. Act done under threat of death (section 94).\n\n17. Acts causing slight harm (section 95).\n\n18. Acts done in private defence (sections 96–106).\n\n1. Act done by a person bound, or by mistake of fact believing himself bound, by law (section 76).\nThe general exception contained in section. 76–106 have the effect of converting an offence into a non-offence. They are of universal nature. They apply to the definition of every offence. Shankar Narayan Bhadolkar v State of Maharashtra, AIR 2004 SC 1966 [LNIND 2004 SC 1370] .\nThe maxim respondent superior has no application to cases where an offence is committed by a subordinate official acting under the orders of his superior. The official is bound to exercise his own judgment and unless the actual circumstances are of such a character that he may have reasonably entertained the belief that the order was one which he was bound to obey, he will be responsible for his act.\nLeading cases:—State of WB v Shew Mangal Singh. R v Latifkhan.\n\n2. Act of a Judge when acting judicially in the exercise of any power which is, or which in good faith he believes to be, given to him by law (section 77).\nA Judge will be protected where he is acting judicially and not ministerially. If he acts without jurisdiction and without good faith, he would be responsible.\n3. Act done pursuant to the judgment or order of a Court of Justice while such judgment or order remains in force, and the person doing the act in good faith believes that the Court has jurisdiction although it has not (section 78). This section differs from the preceding section on the question of jurisdiction. It protects officers acting under the authority of a judgment or order of a court even though the court has no jurisdiction, provided the officer believed in good faith that the Court had jurisdiction.\n4. Act done by a person justified by law, or who by reason of a mistake of fact, and not by reason of a mistake of law, in good faith, believes himself to be justified by law to do it (section 79).\nMistake is a slip made by chance. It is not mere forgetfulness. Under sections 76 and 79 the mistake should be one of fact and not of law. An honest and reasonable belief in the existence of circumstances, which, if true, would make the act for which a prisoner is indicted an innocent act, is a good defence. An alleged offender is deemed to have acted under that state of facts which he, in good faith and on reasonable grounds, believed to exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence. Iqnorantia facti doth excusat, for such an ignorance many times makes the act itself morally involuntary. But if an act is clearly a wrong in itself, and a person, under a mistaken impression as to facts which render it criminal, commits the act, then he is guilty of an offence.\nMistake of law is no defence because every person of the age of discretion is bound to know the law, and presumed to do so. If a person infringes the statute law of the country through ignorance or carelessness he abides by the consequences of his error.\n\nThe maxim ignorantiajuris non excusat admits of no exception in its application to criminal offences. Even a foreigner who cannot reasonably be supposed in fact to know the law of the land is not exempted. Similarly, ignorance of a statute newly passed will not save a person from punishment.\nLeading cases:—R v Prince. R v Tolson. R v Esop. Bhawoo v Mulji. Mayer Hans George. Rajkapoor v Laxman.\nMayne deduces the following five rules, showing the extent to which ignorance of an essential fact may be pleaded as a defence, from the judgments in Prince's case.\n(a) Where an act is in itself plainly criminal, and is more severely punishable if certain circumstances co-exist, ignorance of the existence of such circumstances is no answer to a charge for the aggravated offence.\n(b) Where an act is prima facie innocent and proper, unless certain circumstances coexist, then ignorance of such circumstances is an answer to the charge.\n(c) Even in the last named case, the state of the defendant's mind must amount to absolute ignorance of the existence of the circumstance which alters the character of the act, or to a belief in its non-existence.\n(d) Where an act which is itself wrong is, under certain circumstances, criminal, a person who does the wrong act cannot set up as a defence that he was ignorant of the facts which turned the wrong into a crime.\n(e) Where a statute makes it penal to do an act under certain circumstances, it is a question upon the wording and object of the particular statute whether the responsibility of ascertaining that the circumstances exist is thrown upon the person who does the act or not. In the former case his knowledge is immaterial.\n5. Accident. This must have been caused—\n\n(1) without criminal knowledge or intention,\n(2) in the doing of a lawful act,\n(i) in a lawful manner,\n(ii) by lawful means, and\n(iii) with proper care and caution (section 80).\n\nAn 'accident' is something that happens out of the ordinary course of things.\n\n6. Act done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause harm but done in good faith and without any criminal intention to cause harm, for the purpose of preventing, or avoiding, other harm to person or property (section 81).\n\n\n\nMens rea\n\nIt is a maxim of English law that actus non facitreum, nisi mens sit rea (the intent and act must both concur to constitute a crime). A crime is not committed if the mind of the person doing the act in question be innocent. The above maxim has undergone a modification owing to the greater precision of modern statutes. Crimes are now more accurately defined by statutes than before. It has become necessary to look at the object of each Act that is under consideration to see whether and how far knowledge is\n\nof the essence of the offences created. In three cases mens rea is not an essential ingredient in an offence:\n(1) cases not criminal in real sense, but which, in the public interest, are prohibited under a penalty;\n(2) public nuisances; and\n\n(3) cases criminal in form but which are only a summary mode of enforcing a civil right.\n\nThe above maxim has little application to offences under IPC, 1860, in its purely technical sense because the definitions of various offences expressly contain an ingredient as to the state of mind of the accused. Under the Code, therefore, mens rea will mean one thing or another according to a particular offence. The guilty mind may be a dishonest mind, or a fraudulent mind, or a rash or negligent mind, and so forth.\nIt may be observed that criminal law has nothing to do with motives of offenders. Intention is quite different from motive. A person may do an act with a very high and laudable motive but if his act amounts to a crime he will be guilty. Where some Hindus removed cows from the possession of some Mohammedans to prevent the cows from being slaughtered, they were held guilty of theft.\nWhether a person can for self-preservation inflict harm on others is discussed at p 64. Such acts will not exempt the offender from the full severity of law. It is murder to kill another to save one's own life.\nLeading cases:—R v Dudley (or Mignonette case). South Wark London Borough Council v Williams.\n7. Act done by a child under seven years (section 82); or by a child above seven and under 12 years, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge of the nature and consequences of his conduct (section 83).\nLeading case:—Hiralal.\n\n8. Act done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind,\nis\n\n(1) incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or\n\n(2) that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law (section 84).\n\nThe 'unsoundness of mind' may be temporary or permanent, natural or supervening. But it must affect the cognitive faculties of the mind. If the offender is conscious that the act was contrary to law and one which he ought not to do, he is punishable. The act to be not punishable must be such as would have been excused by law, if the facts had been as the person of unsound mind supposed. Distinction has to be made between legal insanity and medical insanity. Bapu v State of Rajasthan, (2007) 8 SCC 66 [LNIND 2007 SC 774] .\nLeading cases:—R v M'Naughton. R v Lakshman. R v Sakharam. Dahyabhai. S W Mohammad. Ahamadulla.\nThe doctrine of irresistible criminal impulse was not accepted by the Calcutta High Court.\n9. Act done by a person who, at the time of doing it, by reason of intoxication, is\n\n(1) incapable of knowing the nature of the act; or\n\n(2) that he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law:\n\nprovided that the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will (section 85).\nIf an intoxicated person commits an offence requiring a particular intent or knowledge, he is dealt with as if he had that intent or knowledge, unless the thing which intoxicated him was administered to him without his knowledge or against his will (section 86).\nDrunkenness is one thing and the disease to which it may lead is a different thing. If a man by drunkenness, brings on a state of disease which causes such a degree of madness, even for a time, which would relieve him of responsibility if it had been caused in any other way, then he would not be criminally responsible.\nLeading cases:—Basdev. Director of Public Prosecutions v Beard. Davis.\n\n10. Act not intended, and not known, to be likely to cause death or grievous hurt, done by consent of the person, above 18 years to whom harm is caused (section 87).\nOrdinary games, such as fencing, boxing, football and the like are protected by this section.\n11. Act not intended, and not known to be likely to cause death, done in good faith by consent of the person to whom harm is caused for his benefit (section 88).\nSurgical operations are protected under this section.\n\n12. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person under 12 years, or of an insane person, by or by the consent of his guardian. This exception does not extend to:—\n(1) Intentional causing, or attempting to cause, death.\n\n(2) The doing of anything which the doer knows to be likely to cause death, except to prevent death or grievous hurt, or to cure any grievous disease or infirmity.\n(3) Voluntary causing, or attempting to cause, grievous hurt (except as above).\n\n(4) The abetment of any offence, to the committing of which it would not extend (section 89).\nA consent to be a true one must not have been given—\n\n(1) by a person under fear of injury;\n(2) by a person under a misconception of fact;\n(3) by a person of unsound mind, and the person obtaining the consent knows or has reason to believe this;\n(4) by a person who is intoxicated, and who is unable to understand the nature and consequence of that to which he gives his consent;\n(5) by a person under 12 years of age (section 90).\n\nAn honest misconception by both the parties, however, does not invalidate the consent.\n\nLeading case:—Williams.\n\nSections 87, 88 and 89 do not extend to acts which are offences independently of any harm which they may cause to the person giving the consent (section 91), e.g., causing\n\nmiscarriage, public nuisance, offences against public safety, etc.\n\n13. Act done in good faith for the benefit of a person, even without consent, if it is impossible for him to give consent, or is incapable of giving it, and there is no guardian from whom it is possible to obtain it in time for the thing to be done with benefit (section 92). This exception is subject to the same provisos as section 89, with the difference that it will not extend to causing hurt except to prevent death or hurt.\n14. A communication made in good faith, although causing harm to the person to whom it is made, if it is for his benefit (section 94), e.g., communication in good faith by a surgeon to a patient that in his opinion he cannot live.\n15. Act [except (a) murder, and (b) offence against the State punishable with death] done under threats which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension of instant death; provided the doer did not of his own accord, or from an apprehension of harm short of death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint (section 94). Fear of grievous hurt is not a sufficient justification. Mere menace of future death will not be sufficient.\nNo one can plead the excuse of necessity or compulsion as a defence to an act otherwise penal except as provided by this section.\nLeading cases:—R v Deoji. R v Latifkhan. R v Maganlal.\n\n16. Act causing such a slight harm that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of it (section 95).\nThis section deals with those cases which come within the letter of the penal law but not within its spirit. It is based on the maxim de minimis non curatlex (the law does not take account of trifles).\n\n\n\nPrivate defence.\n\n17. Act done in exercise of the right of private defence (section 96). Every person has a right, subject to certain restrictions, to defend,\n(1) his own body and the body of any other person against any offence affecting the human body;\n(2) the property, whether movable or immovable, of himself or of any other person, against any act, which is an offence falling under the definition of theft, robbery, mischief, or criminal trespass, or which is an attempt to commit any of such offences (section 97).\n(3) against an act, which would otherwise be a certain offence, but is not that offence, by reason of the doer being of unsound mind, a minor, an intoxicated person, or a person acting under a misconception of fact (section 98).\nThe right of private defence is a defence right. It is neither a right of aggression nor of reprisal. Thankachan v State of Kerala, (2008) 17 SCC 760 . The right is available not only to the person put in danger but also to any member of the society who rises to the occasion with a spirit of rescue. Such a samaritan gets no legal right against the person rescued. Kashi Ram v State of Rajasthan, (2008) 3 SCC 55 [LNIND 2008 SC 187]\n.\n\nExceptions to the right of private defence.\n\nThere is no right of private defence against the following acts:—\n\n(1) An act which does not reasonably cause apprehension of death or of grievous hurt, if done, or attempted to be done, by a public servant acting in good faith under colour of his office, though that act may not be strictly justifiable by law.\n(2) Same as above if done by the direction of a public servant.\n\n(3) Cases in which there is time to have recourse to the protection of public authorities (section 99).\nLeading Cases:—Amjadkhan. Jaidev.\n\nThe right of private defence does not extend to the inflicting of more harm than it is necessary to inflict for the purpose of defence (ibid).\n\n\n\nDefence of body.\n\nThe right of private defence of the body extends to the causing of death or any other harm to the assailant under the following circumstances:—\n(1) An assault causing reasonable apprehension of death.\n\nIn this case if the defender be so situated that he cannot exercise the right without risk of harm to an innocent person, he may even run that risk (section 106).\n(2) An assault causing reasonable apprehension of grievous hurt.\n\n(3) An assault with the intention of committing rape.\n\n(4) An assault with intention of gratifying unnatural lust.\n\n(5) An assault with intention of kidnapping or abducting.\n\n(6) An assault with the intention of wrongfully confining a person under circumstances which may cause him to apprehend that he will be unable to have recourse to the public authorities for his release.\n(7) \"Seventhly.—An act of throwing or administering acid or an attempt to throw or administer acid which may reasonably cause the apprehension that grievous hurt will otherwise be the consequence of such act\" (section 100).\nLeading case:—Vishwanath.\n\nSubject to the above restrictions, the right of private defence of body extends to the causing of any harm short of death (section 101).\nIt commences as soon as a reasonable apprehension of danger to the body arises from an attempt or threat to commit the offence, though the offence may not have been committed; and it continues as long as such apprehension of danger to the body continues (section 102).\n\n\n\nDefence of property.\n\nThe right of private defence of property extends to the causing of death or any other harm to the assailant under the following circumstances:—\n(1) Robbery.\n\n(2) House-breaking by night.\n\n(3) Mischief by fire to building, tent, or vessel, used as human dwelling or for custody of property.\n(4) Theft, mischief, or house-trespass, reasonably causing the apprehension of death or grievous hurt (section 103).\nSubject to the above restrictions, the right of private defence of property extends to the causing of any harm short of death (section 104). It commences when a reasonable apprehension of danger to the property commences and continues against—\n\n(1) Theft, till\n(a) the offender has affected his retreat with the property, or\n(b) the assistance of the public authorities is obtained, or\n(c) the property has been recovered.\n(2) Robbery, as long as\n(a) the offender causes or attempts to cause to any person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or\n(b) the fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant personal restraint continues.\n(3) Criminal trespass or mischief as long as the offender continues in the commission of criminal trespass, or mischief.\n(4) House-breaking by night, as long as the house-trespass, which has been begun by such house-breaking, continues (section 105).\nAll the provisions relating to private defence from section 96 to section 106 have to be read together in order to have a proper grasp of the scope and limitations of this right.\nLeading case:—Munney Khan v State.\n\nExcessive use of the right of private defence is a matter which can be determined only on the facts of each case. It necessitates a combined view of subjective and objective factors.\nLeading case:—Yogendra Morarji.\n\nMere verbal exchanges, however hot or abusive, do not create the right of private defence.\nLeading case:—Jai Chand v State.\n\nThere is no right of private defence in a free fight.\n\nLeading case:—Sikhar Bahera v State of Orissa. An aggressor has no right of private defence.\n\nLeading case:—Dhananjai v State of UP, AIR 1996 SC 556 .\n\n\n\nAbetment, Chapter V.\n\nThere are three kinds of abetment dealt with in the Code. A person abets the doing of a thing, who\n(1) instigates any person to do that thing; or\n\n(2) engages with one or more other person or persons, in any conspiracy for the doing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of the conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing; or\n(3) intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.\n\nAn abettor can be convicted, except in some cases, even where the principal culprit stands acquitted.\nLeading cases:—Hardhan Chakrabarty v UOI Faguna Kedar Nath v State of Bihar Jamuna Singh v State of Bihar.\nAbetment is separate and independent offence. Kishori Lal v State of MP, (2007) 10 SCC 297 .\nThe law of abetment is adapting itself to the social malaise of dowry which leads to suicides by married women.\nLeading cases:—Gurbachan Singh v Satpal Singh. Brij Lal v Prem Chand.\n\nA person who, by wilful misrepresentation, or by wilful concealment of a material fact which he is bound to disclose, voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing (section 107).\nLeading Cases:—Pratima Datta. Shri Ram.\n\nIt is not necessary that the person incited should have a mens rea corresponding to that of the inciter DPP v Armstrong.\nAn abettor is a person who abets\n\n(a) the commission of an offence, or\n\n(b) the commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by law of committing an offence, with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor (section 108).\nIt should be noted that—\n\n(1) Abetment of an illegal omission may amount to an offence (ib.,Explanation 1).\n\n(2) It is not necessary that the act abetted should be committed (ib.,Explanation 2).\n\n(3) The person abetted need not be capable of committing an offence, nor have any guilty intention or knowledge (ib.,Explanation 3).\n(4) The abetment of an abetment is an offence (ib.,Explanation 4).\n\n(5) It is not necessary in abetment by conspiracy that the abettor should concert the offence with the person abetted (ib., Explanation 5).\n(6) A person will be guilty of abetment who abets the commission of any act without and beyond India which would constitute an offence if committed in India (section 108A).\nIf the act abetted is committed but no express provision is made for its punishment, then it shall be punished with the punishment provided for the offence abetted (section 109).\nIf a person abetted does the act with a different intention or knowledge from that of the abettor, the latter will be punished as if the act had been done with his intention or knowledge (section 110). The liability of the person abetted is not affected by this section.\nIf the act done is different from the one abetted, the abettor is still liable for it, if it is a probable consequence of the abetment, and committed under the influence of the abetment (section 111). The liability is the same where the effect produced is different from that intended by the abettor (section 113).\nThe abettor is liable to cumulative punishment for the act abetted and for the act done if the latter is a distinct offence (section 112).\nIf the abettor is present when the offence abetted is committed, he is deemed to have committed such act or offence (section 114).\nMere presence will not render a person liable. He must be sufficiently near to give assistance, and he must participate in the act, no matter whether he is an eye-witness to the transaction or not. Presence during the whole transaction is not necessary (ibid). Lending encouragement and assistance would amount to abetment even if the abettor was not present at the place where the killing took place. R v Cook. A constable who kept watch while the head constable was committing rape inside their police station, was held liable as an abettor. Ram Kumar v State of HP.\nIf an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life is abetted and no express provision is made for the punishment of such abetment, then the offender will be punished with imprisonment extending to seven years if the offence is not committed; but if an act causing harm is done in consequence, the imprisonment shall be extended to 14 years (section 115). If in such a case the offence is punishable with imprisonment, then the offender is punishable with imprisonment which may extend to one-fourth part of the longest term provided for that offence (section 116). If in the above case the abettor or person abetted be a public servant whose duty it is to prevent such offence, the imprisonment may extend to one-half of the longest term provided for the offence (ibid).\nAbetting commission of an offence by the public or by more than ten persons is punishable with imprisonment extending to three years (section 117).\nThere are three sections which punish concealment of a design to commit offences by persons other than the accused, viz., sections 118, 119 and 120.\n\n\n\nCriminal conspiracy. Chapter VA.\n\nCriminal conspiracy is now a substantive offence under the Code. It was formerly punishable only as a species of abetment. It arises when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be done—\n\n(a) an illegal act; or\n\n(b) an act which is not illegal, by illegal means.\n\nSuch an agreement may be to commit an offence. But if it is not so, it is necessary that some overt act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to such agreement in pursuance thereof (section 120A) SC Bahri v State of Bihar, (Supreme Court). It is difficult to prove conspiracy by direct evidence, Hina Lal Harilal. If the offence conspired to is punishable with death, imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for two years or upwards, the offender is punishable in the same manner as an abettor: but in any other case, he is liable to be punished with rigorous imprisonment for six months, or fine, or both (section 120B). Conspiracy has to be treated as a continuing offence.\nA single person can be tried and convicted for the offence. It is not necessary that conspirators must be known to each other or that every one of them should have taken part in each and every act done in pursuance of the conspiracy. A wife joining her husband with knowledge that he was involved in a conspiracy with others was held to be equally guilty. R v Charstny.\nLeading cases:—Mirza Akbar. Bhagat Ram. Bhagwandas. V C Shukla. Kehar Singh Krishan Lal Pradhan Vinayak\n\n\n\nOffences against the State. Chapter VI.\n\nOffences against the State may be classified as follows:—\n\nI. Waging war against the Government of India.\nII. Assaulting high officers.\nIII. Sedition.\nIV. Waging war against a Power at peace with the Government of India.\nV. Permitting or aiding the escape of a State prisoner.\n\nI. Waging war against the Government of India.\n\n1. Waging or attempting to wage war, or abetting waging of war (section 121).\n\n2. Conspiring to commit, within or without India, offences punishable by section 121 (section 121A).\n3. Collecting men, arms, or ammunition, or making any other preparation with a view to waging such war (section 122).\n4. Concealing a design to wage war with intent to facilitate waging of such war by any act or illegal omission (section 123).\nII. Assaulting the President, or the Governor of any State, with intent to compel or restrain the exercise of any lawful power (section 124).\n\n\n\nSedition.\n\nIII. A person commits sedition who,\n\n(1) by words (spoken or written), or by visible representation,\n\n(2) brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards,\n(3) the Government established by law in India (section 124A).\n\nIt should be noted that—\n\n(1) 'Disaffection' includes disloyalty and feeling of enmity (ibid.,Explanation 1).\n\n(2) Comments expressing disapprobation of the measures of Government to obtain their alteration, without exciting hatred, contempt, or disaffection, do not constitute this offence (ibid., Explanation 2).\n(3) Comments expressing disapprobation of the administrative actions of Government, without exciting hatred, contempt, or disaffection, do not constitute this offence (ibid., Explanation 3).\nUnder the Constitution, criticism of the Government exciting disaffection or bad feelings towards it is not to be regarded as a justifying ground for restricting the freedom of expression and of the press unless it is such as to undermine the security of or tend to overthrow the Government. This section is not ultra vires the Constitution.\nAnyone who uses in any way words or printed matter for the purpose of exciting disaffection, be he the writer of those words or not, is liable. Publication of some kind is necessary. The successful exciting of feelings of disaffection is placed on the same footing as the unsuccessful attempt to excite them.\nThe law does not excuse the publication in newspapers of seditious writing copied from other papers. The editor of a paper is liable for seditious letters appearing in the paper.\nLeading cases:—R v Bal Gangadhar Tilak. R v Jogendra Chandra Bose (or Bangobasi case). Romesh Thappar. Kedar Nath.\nIV. Waging war against a Power at peace with the Government of India.\n\n1. Waging, attempting to wage, or abetting the waging of such war against the Government of any Asiatic Power at peace with the Government of India (section 125).\n2. Committing, or preparing to commit, depredation on the territories of any Power at peace with the Government of India (section 126).\n3. Receiving any property, knowing the same to have been taken in the commission of any of the offences mentioned in the two last preceding sections (section 127).\nV. Permitting or aiding the escape of a State prisoner.\n\n1. Public servant voluntarily allowing a prisoner of State or war, in his custody, to escape (section 128).\n2. Public servant negligently suffering a prisoner of State or war in his custody, to escape (section 129).\n3. Aiding the escape, or rescuing, or attempting to rescue or harbouring, or concealing or resisting the recapture, of such prisoner (section 130).\n\nArmy, Navy & Air Force offences. Chapter VII.\n\nNo person, subject to Articles of War, is subject to punishment under this Code for any offence relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force defined in this Chapter (section 139).\nThis Chapter is framed in order that persons, not military, who abet a breach of military discipline, should not be liable under the military penal law but under the Code.\nThe following offences relating to the Army, Navy and Air Force find place in the Code:\n—\n\n1. Abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce any officer, soldier, sailor, or airman, from his allegiance or duty (section 131).\n2. Abetment of mutiny, if mutiny is committed in consequence (section 132).\n\n3. Abetment of an assault by an officer, soldier, sailor or airman, on his superior officer, when in the execution of his office (section 133).\n4. Abetment of such an assault if the assault is committed (section 134).\n\n5. Abetment of the desertion of an officer, soldier, sailor, or airman (section 135).\n\n6. Knowingly harbouring deserter (section 136).\n\n7. Concealment of deserter from Army, Navy or Air Force of the Government of India concealed on board a merchant vessel through negligence of master or person in charge of the vessel though he is ignorant of such concealment (section 137).\n8. Abetment of act of insubordination by an officer, soldier, sailor, or airman, the act abetted being actually committed in consequence of the abetment (section 138).\n9. Wearing the garb, or carrying any token resembling any garb or token used by a soldier, sailor or airman with the intention that it may be believed that the wearer is a soldier, sailor or airman (section 140). The gist of the offence is the intention of the accused. Merely wearing a soldier's dress without the specific intention is no offence, e.g., actors put on soldier's garb while acting on the stage.\nThere are six sections in the Code dealing with false personation—\n\n1. Personation of a soldier (section 140).\n\n2. Personation of a public servant (section 170).\n\n3. Wearing the garb or carrying the token used by a public servant (section 171).\n\n4. Personation of a voter at an election (section 171D).\n\n5. Personation for the purpose of an act or proceeding in a suit or prosecution (section 205).\n6. Personation of a juror or assessor (section 229).\n\n\n\nPublic tranquillity. Chapter VIII.\n\nOffences against public tranquillity hold a middle place between the State offences on the one hand and crimes against person and property on the other. They are four:\n\nI. Unlawful Assembly. different\nII. Rioting.\nIII. Promoting enmity between classes.\nIV. Affray.\n\n\n\nUnlawful assembly.\n\nI. An 'unlawful assembly' is an assembly of five or more persons, if their common object is\n\n1. To overawe by criminal force—\n(a) the Central or any State Government, or\n(b) the Parliament, or\n(c) the Legislature of any State, or\n(d) any public servant in the exercise of his lawful power.\n2. To resist the execution of law or legal process.\n3. To commit mischief, criminal trespass, or other offences.\n4. By criminal force—\n(a) to take or obtain possession of any property, or\n(b) to deprive any person of any incorporeal right, or\n(c) to enforce any right or supposed right.\n5. By criminal force to compel any person—\n(a) to do what he is not legally bound to do, or\n(b) to omit what he is legally entitled to do (section 141).\n\n[Six months, or fine, or both. If armed with a deadly weapon, two years, or fine, or both (sections 143, 144).]\nThe assembly must consist of five or more persons. It is immaterial whether the common object is in their minds when they come together, or whether it occurs to them afterwards. There must be some present and immediate purpose of carrying into effect the common object. A meeting for deliberation only is not an unlawful assembly. Persons maintaining their own right or supposed right against the aggression of other people do not commit this offence. Common object means same or similar object; it is not necessary to have a preconcert or prior meeting of minds.\nAn assembly not unlawful when it assembled may subsequently become an unlawful one (section 143, Explanation). Illegal acts of one or two members do not change the lawful character of an assembly. Similarly, a lawful assembly does not become unlawful merely because the members know that their assembly would be opposed and a breach of the peace would be committed.\nWhoever, being aware of facts which render an assembly an unlawful one, intentionally joins it, or continues in it, is a member of that assembly (section 142). Persons may have associated themselves with a mob from perfectly innocent motives, but if the\n\nmob becomes an unlawful assembly, and they take part in its proceedings, they will be liable. Every such member is deemed guilty of an offence committed in prosecution of the common object. There must be nexus between the common object and the offence committed.\nLeading case:—Allauddin Mia.\n\nIf an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as the members of that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time of the committing of that offence, is a member of the said assembly, is guilty of that offence (section 149). This section prevents the accused from putting forth the defence that he did not with his own hand commit the offence committed in prosecution of the common object. Common object does not mean common intention. All will be guilty of any offence done in prosecution of the common object, though there was no common intention to commit the offence as a means to the end. But members of an unlawful assembly may have a community of object only up to a certain point and beyond that they may differ in their objects.\nLeading cases:—R v Sabedali; Dalip Singh; Khudiram; Mushakhan; Beatty v Gillbanks.\n\nThe common object may develop at the spot itself.\n\nLeading case:—Vithal Bhimshah Kali.\n\nOther cognate offences—\n\n1. Joining an unlawful assembly armed with a deadly weapon (section 144).\n\n2. Joining or continuing in an unlawful assembly knowing it has been commanded to disperse (section 145).\n3. Hiring of persons to join an unlawful assembly (section 150).\n\n4. Harbouring persons hired for an unlawful assembly (section 157).\n\n5. Being hired to take part in an unlawful assembly (section 158).\n\nPersons, who are engaged or hired to do any of the acts which make an assembly unlawful, are likewise punished (ibid).\n\n\n\nRiot.\n\nII. When (1) force of violence is used, (2) by an unlawful assembly or by any member thereof, (3) in prosecution of the common object, every member is guilty of rioting (section 146). [Two years or fine, or both. If armed with a deadly weapon, Three years, or fine, or both (section 148).]\nRiot is an unlawful assembly in a particular state of activity. To constitute the offence of rioting it must be proved:\n\n(1) that the accused, being five or more in number, formed an unlawful assembly;\n(2) that they were animated by a common unlawful object;\n(3) that force or violence was used by the unlawful assembly or any member of it; and\n\n(4) that such force was used in prosecution of the common object.\n\nIf the common object of an assembly is not illegal, it is not rioting even if force is used by a member of it. If persons lawfully assembled for any purpose suddenly quarrel they do not commit riot.\nOther cognate offences—\n\n1. Rioting with deadly weapons (section 148).\n2. Hiring or conniving at hiring of persons to join unlawful assembly (section. 150).\n3. Assaulting or obstructing a public servant in the suppression of a riot (section. 152).\n4. Malignantly or wantonly giving provocation with intent to cause riot (section. 153).\nLiability of persons who provide space\n\nLiability of persons who own, occupy, or have an interest in land, is governed by the following provisions:\n(1) The owner, or any person having or claiming an interest in land upon which an unlawful assembly is held, or riot is committed, is punishable with Rs. 1,000 fine, if he or his agent (a) knowing of the offence do not give the earliest notice thereof at the nearest police station; or (b) believing the offence likely to be committed do not use any lawful means to prevent it; or (c) in the event of the offence taking place do not use all lawful means to disperse the unlawful assembly or suppress the riot (section 154).\n(2) Where a riot is committed on behalf of a person who is the owner or occupier of land respecting which such riot takes place, or who claims any interest in such land, or in the subject of any dispute which caused the riot, such person is liable to a fine, if he or his agent having reason to believe that the riot is likely to be committed, or the unlawful assembly causing the riot is likely to be held, fails to use all lawful means for preventing the riot, or for suppressing and dispersing the same (section 155).\nUnder similar circumstances, the agent or manager is punishable likewise (section 156).\n\n\n\nPromoting enmity, etc.\n\nIII. (a) Promoting disharmony or enmity or hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language, caste or community groups on grounds of religion, race, language, caste or community, or\n(b) Committing act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony or disturbing public tranquillity,\nby words or signs, or visible representations, or otherwise [Three years, or fine, or both].\n\n(c) Committing offence as stated in paras (a) and (b) in a place of worship or in any assembly engaged in religious worship or ceremonies (section 153A). [Five years and fine].\n(d) Knowingly carrying arms in any procession or organizing, or holding taking part in ant mass drill mort mass training with (section 153AA) [Six months and fine.]\n\nLeading cases:—Babu Rao Patel. Varsha Publications Pvt Ltd. Nand Kishore Singh. Chandanmal Chopra.\n\n\n\nAffray.\n\nIV. When (1) two or more persons, (2) by fighting in a public place, (3) disturb the public peace, they commit an affray (section 159). [One month or Rs. 100, or both (section 160).]\nThe word 'affray' is derived from the French word affraier, to terrify. An 'affray' is an offence against the public peace because it is committed in a public place and is likely to cause general alarm and disturbance. 'Public place' is a place where the public go, no matter whether they have a right to go or not. No quarrelsome or threatening words will amount to an affray.\nAn 'affray' differs from a 'riot'.\n\n(1) An affray cannot be committed in a private place, a riot can be.\n\n(2) An affray is committed by two or more persons, a riot by five or more.\n\n(3) A riot is more severely punishable than an affray.\n\nPersons other than the actual rioters are punishable in respect of riot in the following cases:—\n(1) Owner or occupier of land on which an unlawful assembly is held (section 154).\n\n(2) The person for whose benefit a riot is committed (section 155).\n\n(3) The agent of owner or occupier for whose benefit a riot is committed(section 156).\n\n(4) One who knowingly harbours, in any house or premises under his control, any persons being or about to be hired or employed as members of an unlawful assembly (section 157).\n(5) One who is engaged, or hired, or offers to be hired, to do or assist in doing any of the acts specified in s. 141, as making an assembly unlawful (section 158).\n\n\n\nOffences by or relating to public servants. Chapter IX.\n\nChapter IX deals with offences by or relating to public servants. They are as follows:—\n\nNote:Sections 161 to 165A have been repealed by the Prevention of Corruption Act (vide, amendment of 1988).\n\n1. Whoever being, or expecting to be, a public servant\n(i) accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept, or attempts to obtain, any\ngratification other than legal remuneration,\n(ii) as a reward for\n(a) doing or forbearing to do any official act, or\n(b) showing or forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in\n\nthe exercise of his official functions, or\n(c) rendering or attempting to render any service or dis-service to any person, with the Central or any State Government or Parliament or the Legislature of any State, or a public servant,\nis guilty of taking illegal gratification (section 161). [Three years, or fine or both.] It is essential that the gratification should be obtained \"as a motive or reward\".\nLeading cases:—Mahesh. Maha Singh. R S Nayak v A R Antulay.\n\n2. Taking a gratification in order by corrupt or illegal means to influence a public servant (section 162). [Three years, or fine or both.]\n3. Taking a gratification for the exercise of personal influence with a public servant (section 163). [One year's simple imprisonment, or fine, or both.]\n4. Public servant abetting either of the two last mentioned offences (section 164).\n\n5. Public servant obtaining any valuable thing, without consideration, from a person concerned in any proceeding or business transacted by such public servant (section 165).\n6. Abetting a public servant in committing an offence under section 161 or section 165 (section 165A).\n7. Public servant knowingly disobeying law with intent to cause injury to any person (section 166).\n9. Public servant disobeying direction under law (section 166A).\n\n10. Punishment for non-treatment of victim (166B).\n\n8. Public servant framing or translating a document in a way which he knows or believes to be incorrect, intending to cause injury to any person (section 167).\n9. Public servant unlawfully engaging in trade (section 168).\n\n10. Public servant unlawfully buying or bidding for property (section 169).\n\n11. Personating a public servant, and doing or attempting to do an act in such assumed character under colour of office (section 170).\n12. Wearing a garb or carrying a token used by a public servant with fraudulent intent (section 171).\n\n\n\nOffences relating to elections. Chapter IXA.\n\nChapter IXA deals with offences relating to elections. It seeks to make punishable, under the ordinary penal law, bribing, undue influence, and personation, and certain other malpractices at elections. It applies to membership of any public body where the law prescribes a method of election. Persons guilty of malpractices are debarred from holding positions of public responsibility for a specified period. The following are deemed to be offences under this chapter:—\n1. Giving or accepting gratification with the object of exercising any electoral right (section 171B). Gratification includes treating, i.e., giving of food, drink, entertainment or provisions (section 171E).\n\n2. Interfering with the free exercise of any electoral right (clause 1), threatening any candidate or voter, or any person in whom he is interested, with injury of any kind; or inducing any candidate or voter to believe that he or any person in whom he is interested will become an object of Divine displeasure or of spiritual censure (clause 2) (section 171C).\nSomething more than a mere act of canvassing would be necessary: Charan Lal Sahu v Giani Zail Singh.\n3. Personation at an election (section 171D).\n\n4. Publishing false statements in relation to the personal character or conduct of any candidate (section 171G).\n5. Illegal payments in connection with an election (section 171H).\n\n6. Failure to keep election accounts (section 171I).\n\n\n\nContempt of the authority of public servants. Chapter X.\n\nChapter X deals with contempt of the lawful authority of public servants. It contains those provisions which are intended to enforce obedience to the lawful authority of public servants.\nThe following provisions relate to wilful omission or evasion of the performance of a public duty:—\n1. Absconding to avoid service of a summons, notice, order or other proceeding from a public servant (section 172).\n'Absconding' here means simply hiding. The section does not speak of a warrant.\n\n2. Preventing service of summons or other proceeding, or removing the same from any place to which it is lawfully affixed, or preventing the making of any proclamation under due authority of publication thereof (section 173).\n3. Non-attendance, in obedience to a summons, notice, order, or proclamation proceeding from a public servant in person or by agent, or having attended, departing before it is lawful to depart (section 174).\n4. Non-appearance in response to a proclamation under section 82 of Act 2 of 1974\n(section 174A)\n\n[Failure by person released on bail or bond to appear in court is an offence under\nsection 229A.]\n\nThe attendance must be in a place in India. The summons should be specific in its terms as to the title of the Court, the place at which, the day, and the time of the day when the attendance is required. A verbal order is quite sufficient. Mere affixing of summons to a house is not enough; personal service must be attempted.\n4. Intentional omission to produce or deliver up any document to a public servant by person legally bound to produce such document (section 175).\n5. Intentional omission to give, or furnish, at the time and in the manner aforesaid by law, any notice or information to a public servant (section 176).\n\n6. Section 202, though not appearing in this Chapter, punishes intentional omission to give information of offence by person bound to inform.\n7. Intentional omission to assist public servant in the execution of his duty when bound by law to give assistance (section 187).\nA person refusing to give true information to a public servant will be liable under the following circumstances:—\n1. Refusing on oath or affirmation to state the truth when required by a public servant legally competent to require it (section 178).\nThe penalty of the section would not be attracted where the refusal to take oath would be justifiable: Kiran Bedi and Inder Singh v Commission of Inquiry.\n2. Refusing by a person legally bound to state the truth, to answer any question, demanded of him by a public servant authorized to question (section 179).\nA person examined under section 161 of Cr PC is now legally bound to state the truth.\n\nLeading case:—Nandini Sathpathy.\n\n3. Refusing to sign any statement made by the party when required by a public servant legally competent to require that he shall sign it (section 180).\nA person giving false information to a public servant is liable in the following cases:—\n\n1. Furnishing, as true, information which the person furnishing same, being legally bound to furnish, knows or has reason to believe to be false [six months simple imprisonment, Rs. 1,000 fine]. If the information respects the commission of an offence, or prevention of it, or the apprehension of an offender—two years' imprisonment or fine (section 177).\n2. False statement on oath to a public servant, or person authorised to administer oath, by a person legally bound to state the truth on the subject in question (section 181).\nThis section refers to cases in which the false statements are made to any public servant in proceedings other than judicial.Section 191 refers to judicial proceedings.\n3. Whoever gives to any public servant any information which he knows or believes to be false, intending thereby to cause, or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby cause, such public servant—\n\n(a) to do or omit to do anything which such public servant ought not to do or omit if the true state of facts respecting which such information is given were known by him, or\n(b) to use the lawful power of such public servant to the injury or annoyance of any person (section 182).\n4. Section 203, though not appearing in this chapter, punishes the giving of false information respecting an offence.\nThe following provisions deal with obstructing or disobeying a public servant:—\n\n1. Resistance to the taking of property by the lawful authority of a public servant (section 183).\n\n2. Obstructing the sale of property offered for sale by the lawful authority of a public servant (section 184).\n3. Illegal purchase or bid for property, offered for sale by the authority of a public servant, on account of any person, whether himself or any other, who is under a legal incapacity to purchase that property at such sale, or bid for such property not intending to perform the obligation thereby, incurred (section 185).\n4. Obstructing a public servant in the discharge of his public functions (section 186).\n\n5. Intentional omission to assist public servant in the execution of his duty when bound by law to give assistance (section 187).\n6. Knowingly disobeying an order 'promulgated by a public servant lawfully empowered to promulgate it' (section 188). [If such disobedience tends to cause obstruction or injury to any person lawfully employed, then the punishment is simple imprisonment for one month, or Rs. 200 fine, or both. If it causes riot or affray, or danger to human life, health or safety, then with imprisonment of either description for six months, or Rs. 1,000 fine, or both].\nFor violation of a curfew order under section 144 Cr PC, 1973, only a prosecution under section 188, IPC, 1860, can be launched in an appropriate case but no \"shoot to kill\" order is justified merely on that account.\nThree things are necessary—\n\n(1) A lawful order promulgated by a public servant,\n(2) knowledge of the order and disobedience of it, and\n(3) the adverse result that is likely to follow from such disobedience.\n\nDisobedience per se of an order promulgated under section 144 Cr PC, 1973, is not an offence and that it is necessary to prove that the disobedience would have tended to have certain results mentioned in section 188 IPC, 1860.\nLeading cases:—Saroj Hazra. Jayantilal.\n\n7. Threat of injury to a public servant, or to any person in whom such public servant is believed to be interested in order to induce such public servant to do or refrain from doing an official act (section 189).\n8. Threat of injury to induce any person to refrain from applying for protection to a public servant (section 190).\nChapter XI treats offences relating to false evidence and public justice. A person is said to give 'false evidence', if he\n\n\nFalse evidence. Chapter XI.\n\n(1) being legally bound by an oath, or by an express provision of law to state the truth; or\n(2) being bound by law to make a declaration upon any subject;\n\n(3) makes any statement which is false; and\n\n(4) which he either knows or believes to be false, or does not believe to be true (section 191).\nIf the Court has no authority to administer an oath, or if it has no jurisdiction at all, the proceedings will be without jurisdiction. Oath or solemn affirmation is not a condition precedent to this offence. The false statement need not be material to the case. It is not limited to evidence before a Court of Justice, but covers any statement made, under oath or otherwise, in pursuance of a legal duty to make it. A false allegation in a written statement amounts to this offence. Illegality of a trial does not purge perjury committed in that trial. An accused is not liable if he gives false answers to questions put by the Court.\nA person is said to 'fabricate false evidence' if he\n\n\n\nFabricating false evidence.\n\n(1) causes any circumstance to exist; or\n\n(2) makes any false entry in any book or record; or\n\n(3) makes any document containing a false statement;\n\n(4) intending that such circumstance, false entry or false statement may appear in evidence in (a) a judicial proceeding, or (b) a proceeding taken by law before a public servant or an arbitrator; and\n(5) may cause any person, who in such proceeding is to form an opinion upon the evidence, to entertain an erroneous opinion;\n(6) touching any point material to the result of such proceeding (section 192). [If evidence is given or fabricated for the purpose of being used in any stage of a judicial proceeding, seven years and fine; in any other case, three years and fine (section 193).]\nThis section refers to judicial proceedings. Section 181 refers to any proceeding before a public servant. The definition of 'judicial proceeding' in Cr PC, 1973, is not applicable to sections 192 and 193.\nIntention is the gist of the offence of fabricating false evidence.\n\nThe false evidence must be material to the case, though it may not be so under section\n191. If no erroneous opinion could be formed touching any point material to the result of a proceeding there is no fabrication.\nAs soon as the false evidence is fabricated the offence is complete. Actual use of such evidence is not necessary. Such use is punishable under section 196. The fabricated evidence must, however, be admissible evidence. The offence cannot be committed before a public servant not authorized to hold an investigation.\nWhere a person makes two contradictory statements he can be charged in the alternative and convicted of intentionally giving false evidence, although it cannot be proved which of those contradictory statements is false. KTMS Mohd v UOI, (Supreme Court).\nPersons accused of giving or fabricating false evidence should be tried separately and not jointly.\n\nAn accused person who fabricates evidence to escape punishment is not liable under this section, unless he contemplates injury to someone else.\nThe aggravated forms of these two offences are—\n\n1. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of a capital offence (section 194).\n2. Giving or fabricating false evidence with intent to procure conviction of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment (section 195).\n3. Threatening or inducing any person to give false evidence (section 195A).\n\nThe following offences are punishable in the same manner as the giving of false evidence:—\n1. Issuing or signing any certificate required by law to be given or signed or by law made evidence of any fact knowing or believing that such certificate is false in any material point (section 197).\n2. Using as true a certificate known to be false in a material point (section 198).\n\n3. False statement made in any declaration which touches any material point and which is by law receivable as evidence (section 199).\n4. Using as true any such declaration known to be false in any material point (section 200).\n5. Causing disappearance of evidence of the offence or giving false information to screen offender. The punishment is linked with the type of offence of which the evidence is destroyed. (section 201).\n6. Intentional omission to give information by the person who is bound to inform (section 202).\n7. Giving false information in respect of an offence which has been committed (section 203).\nDestruction or secreting or obliteration of a document to prevent its production in evidence in a court is punishable (section 204).\nThere are two offences in this chapter dealing with false personation.\n\n\n\nPersonation\n\n1. Falsely personating another, and in such assumed character making any admission or statement, or confessing judgment or causing any process to be issued or becoming bail or security, or doing any other act in any suit or prosecution (section 205).\nAny fraudulent gain or benefit to the offender is not necessary.\n\nThe Calcutta High Court has held that a person commits this offence even if he personates a purely imaginary person. The Madras High Court, following English precedents, has held to the contrary.\n2. Personating a juror or assessor. (section 229).\n\nThe following provisions deal with the abuse of process of court:—\n\nAbuse of process of Court.\n\n1. Fraudulent removal or concealment of property to prevent its seizure as forfeiture or in execution of a decree (section 206).\n2. Fraudulent claim to property to prevent its seizure as forfeiture or in execution (section 207).\n3. Fraudulently suffering a decree for a sum not due (section 208).\n\n4. Fraudulently or dishonestly making a false claim in court (section 209).\n\n5. Fraudulently obtaining a decree for a sum not due or causing a decree or order to be executed against any person after it has been satisfied (section 210).\nThe fact that the satisfaction of a decree is of such a nature that the court executing the decree cannot recognize it, does not prevent the decree-holder from being convicted of this offence.\n6. False charge of an offence.\n\nThis has four ingredients:—\n\n(1) Instituting or causing to be instituted any criminal proceedings, or\n\n(2) Falsely charging any person with having committed an offence,\n\n(3) Knowledge that there is no just or lawful ground for it,\n\n(4) Doing as above with intent to cause injury to any person (section 211). [Two years, or fine, or both. If criminal proceedings, be instituted on a false charge of an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for seven years or upwards, then the punishment is seven years and fine.]\nCriminal law may be put in motion—\n\n(1) by giving information to the police, or\n\n(2) by lodging a complaint before a Magistrate.\n\nA false charge to the police in respect of a cognizable offence amounts to institution of criminal proceedings. But as the police have no power to take any proceedings in non- cognizable cases without orders from a Magistrate, a false charge of such offence made to the police is not an institution of criminal proceedings but merely a false charge. No such distinction exists when a false charge of any offence is made before a Magistrate.\nLeading cases:—R v Karim Buksh. R v Jijibhai. Santosh Singh.\n\nFor a false charge of offence of a serious nature severe punishment is provided. According to the Calcutta and the Madras High Courts, in such cases it is not necessary that criminal proceedings should be instituted, the charge should merely relate to a serious offence; whereas the Allahabad High Court has held that criminal proceedings should have been actually instituted.\nLeading cases:—R v Karim Buksh(Cal). R v Nanjunda Row(Mad). R v Bisheshar(All).\n\nThe bringing of a vexatious charge is not an offence under this section. The compounding of the offence alleged to have been committed is no bar to a prosecution\n\nunder this section. The person aggrieved may sue in a civil suit for damages for malicious prosecution instead of instituting criminal proceedings.\nThere is a difference between section 182 and section 211.\n\nBombay High Court.—Under section 182 proof of (1) malice, and (2) want of reasonable and probable cause, except so far as they are implied in the act of giving false information, is not necessary; under section 211 such proof is absolutely required (Raghavendra v Kashinathbhat).\nCalcutta High Court.—Prosecution for a false charge may be under either of these sections. But if the false charge is of a serious nature, section 211 should be applied (Sarada Prosad Chatterjee).\nAllahabad High Court.—Where a specific false charge is made, the proper section to apply is section 211. An offence under section 182 is complete when false information is given to a public servant although the latter takes no steps towards the institution of criminal proceedings (Jugal Kishore; Raghu Tiwari).\nPatna High Court.—It follows the view of the Calcutta High Court.\n\nPunjab.—The former Chief Court of the Punjab followed the view of the Bombay High Court.\n\n\n\nScreening an offender.\n\n1. Causing disappearance of evidence of an offence or giving false information to screen the offender (section 201).\nAn offence should have been actually committed to render a person liable. An offender himself causing the disappearance of evidence can be held liable under this section.\n2. Taking gift to screen an offender from punishment (section 213).\n\n3. Offering gift or restoration of property in consideration of screening an offender (section 214).\nTaking any gratification on account of helping any person to recover any moveable property of which he has been deprived by any offence under this Code is punished unless the person taking gift uses all means in his power to cause the offender to be apprehended (section 215).\n\n\n\nHarbouring an offender.\n\n1. Harbouring or concealing a person knowing him to be an offender with the intention of screening him from legal punishment (section 212).\n2. Harbouring or concealing an offender who has escaped from custody, or whose apprehension has been ordered (section 216).\n3. Knowingly harbouring any persons who are about to commit, or have committed, robbery or dacoity (section 216A).\nThe following provisions deal with offences against public justice committed by public servants:—\n\nOffences by public servants.\n\n1. Public servant knowingly disobeying a direction of law with an intent to save any person from punishment or any property from forfeiture (section 217).\n2. Public servant, charged as such with the preparation of a record or other writing, framing it incorrectly with intent to cause loss or injury to the public or any person, or to save any person from punishment or property from forfeiture (section 218).\n3. Public servant in a judicial proceeding corruptly or maliciously making any report, order, verdict, or decision, knowing that it is contrary to law (section 219).\n4. Public servant corruptly or maliciously committing any person for trial, or keeping any person in confinement knowing that he is acting contrary to law (section 220).\nThe Supreme Court analysed the requirements of this section in Suryamoorthy v Govindaswami.\n5. Public servant intentionally omitting to apprehend, or suffering to escape, any person when legally bound to apprehend or keep him in confinement (section 221).\n6. Same as above, when such person is under sentence or lawfully committed to custody (section 222).\n7. Public servant legally bound to keep in confinement a person charged with, or convicted of, any offence, negligently suffering him to escape (section 223).\n8. Public servant omitting to apprehend or suffering to escape from confinement any person in cases not otherwise provided for (section 225A).\nResisting the law is punishable in the following cases:—\n\n1. A person resisting or obstructing the lawful apprehension of himself for any offence with which he is charged or of which he has been convicted; or escaping or attempting to escape from legal custody (section 224).\n2. Resisting or obstructing lawful apprehension of another person for an offence, or rescuing or attempting to rescue him from legal custody (section 225).\n3. Resistance or obstruction to lawful apprehension, or escaping or rescuing from legal custody in cases not otherwise provided for (section 225B). Violation of condition of remission of punishment (section 227).\n\n\n\nContempt of Court.\n\nA person is guilty of contempt of Court if he intentionally offers any insult or causes any interruption to any public servant, while he is sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding (section 228). [Six months' simple imprisonment, or Rs. 1,000, or both.]\nA person who prints or publishes the name or discloses the identity of the victim of a rape case and other sexual offences under sections 376A, 376B, 376C or 376D without due authorisation or permission of the court shall be punishable with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years and shall also be liable to fine (section 228A).\nThis section, however, does not apply to the publication of the judgment of any High Court or the Supreme Court (Explanation to section 228A).\n\nCoin and Stamps. Chapter XII.\n\nCoin is metal used for the time being as money, and stamped and issued by the authority of some State or Sovereign power in order to be so used. Old coins not used as money are not coins under this definition.\nIndian coin is—\n\n(1) metal stamped and issued—\n\n(a) by the authority of the Government of India,\n(b) in order to be used as money;\n\n(2) Metal which has been so stamped or issued shall continue to be Indian coin notwithstanding that it may have ceased to be used as money (section 230).\nFollowing are the various offences relating to coin:—\n\n1. Counterfeiting coin or Indian coin (sections 231, 232).\n\n2. Making, mending, buying, or selling, or disposing of any die or instrument for counterfeiting coin or Indian coin (sections 233, 234).\n3. Being in possession of any instrument or material for the purpose of using the same for counterfeiting of coin or Indian coin (section 235).\n4. Abetting in India, counterfeiting of coin out of India (section 236).\n\nAbetment must be completed in India.\n\n5. Importing or exporting of a counterfeit coin or Indian coin (sections 237, 238).\n\n6. Delivery to another of a coin or Indian coin possessed with the knowledge that it is counterfeit (sections 239, 240).\n7. Delivery to another of a counterfeit coin as genuine, which, when first possessed, the deliverer did not know to be counterfeit (section 241).\n8. Possession of a counterfeit coin or Indian coin by a person who knew it to be counterfeit when he became possessed thereof (sections 242, 243).\nPossession must be with intent to defraud.\n\n9. Any person employed in a mint causing a coin to be of different weight or composition from that fixed by law (section 244).\n10. Unlawfully taking from a mint any coining instrument or tool (section 245).\n\n11. Fraudulently or dishonestly diminishing the weight or altering the composition of any coin or Indian coin (sections 246, 247).\n12. Altering appearance of any coin or Indian coin with intent that it shall pass as a coin of different description (sections 248, 249).\n13. Delivery to another of a coin or Indian coin possessed with the knowledge that it is altered (sections 250, 251).\nThere must be both possession with knowledge and fraudulent delivery.\n\n14. Possession of an altered coin or Indian coin by a person who knew it to be altered when he became possessed thereof (sections 252, 253).\n15. Delivery to another of an altered coin as genuine, which, when first possessed, the deliverer did not know to be altered (section 254).\nThe following offences relate to Government stamps:—\n\n1. Counterfeiting or performing any part of the process of counterfeiting a government stamp (section 255).\n2. Possession of an instrument or material for the purpose of counterfeiting a government stamp (section 256).\n3. Making, buying, or selling any instrument for the purpose of counterfeiting a government stamp (section 257).\n4. Sale of a counterfeit government stamp (section 258).\n\n5. Possession of a counterfeit government stamp (section 259).\n\n6. Using as genuine a government stamp known to be counterfeit (section 260).\n\n7. Fraudulently affecting any writing from a substance bearing a Government stamp or removing from a document the stamp used for it, with intent to cause loss to the Government (section 261).\n8. Using a government stamp known to have been before used (section 262).\n\n9. Fraudulently erasing from a government stamp any mark denoting that the same has been used, or selling or disposing of a stamp from which such a mark has been erased (section 263).\n10. Possession of a fictitious stamp or of any die, plate or instrument for making any fictitious stamp (section 263A).\n\n\n\nWeights and measures. Chapter XIII.\n\nThe following offences relate to weights and measures:—\n\n1. Fraudulent use of false instruments for weighing (section. 264).\n\n2. Fraudulent use of a false weight or measure or using any weight or measure of length or capacity, as a different weight or measure from what it is (section 265).\n3. Possession of any instrument for weighing, or of any weight or measure of length or capacity, knowing it to be false, intending that the same may be fraudulently used (section 266).\n4. Making, selling, or disposing of any false instrument for weighing or any false weight or measure of any length or capacity in order that the same may be used or knowing that it is likely to be used as true (section 267).\n\n\n\nNuisance. Chapter XIV.\n\nA person is guilty of public nuisance who does\n\n(1) any act, or is guilty of an illegal omission; and\n\n(2) such act or omission causes\n\n(a) any common injury, danger, or annoyance (i) to the public, or (ii) to the people in general who dwell or occupy property in the vicinity; or\n(b) any injury, obstruction, danger, or annoyance to persons who may have occasion to use any public right (section 268).\nNuisance is either (1) public, or (2) private. The former is an offence against the public as it affects the public at large, or some considerable portion of public. It depends in a great measure upon the number of houses and the concourse of people in the vicinity; and the annoyance or neglect must be of a real and substantial nature. Public nuisance cannot be excused on the ground that the act complained of is inconvenient to a large number of the public. Acts which seriously interfere with the health, safety, comfort, or convenience of the public generally, or which tend to degrade public morals, have always been considered public nuisance. A brew-house, glass-house, or swine-yard, may be a public nuisance if it is shown that the trade is such as to render enjoyment of life and property uncomfortable. Public nuisance can only be the subject of one indictment, otherwise a party might be ruined by a million prosecutions. No prescriptive right can be acquired to maintain a public nuisance.\nPrivate nuisance is anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another, and not amounting to trespass. It is an act affecting some particular individual or individuals as distinguished from the public at large. It is in the quantum of annoyance that public nuisance differs from private. Private nuisance cannot be a subject of indictment but a ground of a civil action for damages, or injunction, or both.\nThe following offences affect public health:—\n\n1. Negligent or malignant act likely to spread infection of any disease dangerous to life (sections 269, 270). The Supreme Court considered under this section the position of a person suffering from HIV (AIDS) X v Z.\n2. Wilful disobedience to a quarantine rule (section 271).\n\n3. Adulteration of food or drink intended for sale so as to make it noxious (section 272).\n4. Selling, offering or exposing for sale, as food or drink, any article which has been rendered or has become noxious or unfit for food or drink (section 273).\n5. Adulteration of drug so as to lessen its efficacy, change its operation or render it noxious (section 274).\n6. Knowingly selling or causing to be used for medicinal purposes any adulterated drug (section 275).\n7. Selling, or offering or exposing for sale, or issuing from a dispensary for medicinal purposes, any drug or medical preparation as a different drug or medical preparation (section 276). Possession has been taken to be evidence of intention (sabapathee).\nIn the States of West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh offences under sections 272, 273, 274, 275 and 276 IPC, 1860, have by virtue of local amendments been made cognizable,\n\nnon-bailable and punishable with imprisonment for life (see COMMENT under section\n272).\n\n8. Voluntarily corrupting or fouling the water of a public spring or reservoir so as to render it less fit for the purpose for which it is ordinarily used (section 277).\n9. Voluntarily vitiating the atmosphere so as to make it noxious to the public health (section 278). Carrying such material without proper protection and dumping it at some place, though temporarily, constituted offences. Durham County Council v Peter Connors Industrial Services and R v Metropolitan S Magistrate.\nThe following offences relate to public safety:—\n\n1. Rash or negligent driving or riding on a public way so as to endanger human life, or to cause hurt or injury to any other person (section 279).\nNegligence is the breach of a duty caused by the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or the doing of something which a prudent and reasonable man would not do.\nThere is a distinction between a rash act and a negligent act. Culpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal consequences may follow but with the hope that they will not. Culpable negligence is acting without the consciousness that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow. As between rashness and negligence, rashness is a graver offence.\nLeading cases:—Bhalchandra. Padmacharan Naik.\n\n2. Rash or negligent navigation of a vessel (section 280).\n\n3. Exhibiting any false light, mark, or buoy, intending or knowing it to be likely to mislead any navigator (section 281).\n4. Conveying a person by water for hire in a vessel overloaded or unsafe (section 282). Hijacking and threat to blow up an aircraft have been considered under this section (R v Mason).\n5. Causing danger, obstruction, or injury to any person in a public way or public line of navigation (section 283).\n6. Rash or negligent conduct with respect to any poisonous substance so as to endanger human life, or to be likely to cause hurt or injury to any person (section 284).\n7. Rash or negligent conduct with respect to any fire or combustible matter (section. 285).\n8. Rash or negligent conduct with respect to any explosive substance (section. 286).\n\n9. Rash or negligent conduct with respect to any machinery in the possession or under the charge of the offender (section. 287).\n10. Negligence with respect to pulling down or repairing buildings (section. 288).\n\n11. Negligence with respect to any animal (section. 289).\n\nActs of public nuisance other than those mentioned above are punishable under the general section (section. 290). A person cannot continue a public nuisance after injunction to discontinue (section. 291).\n\nOffences against public morals and decency are:—\n\n1. (a) Selling, letting to hire, distributing, or publicly exhibiting or circulating any obscene book, pamphlet, paper, drawing, painting, representation or figure or any obscene object; or\n(b) importing, exporting, or conveying any obscene object for any of the above purposes; or\n(c) taking part in or receiving profits from any business conducted for the abovementioned purposes; or\n(d) advertising that any person is engaged in any of the abovementioned acts, or that any obscene object can be got from that person; or\n(e) attempting to do any act which is an offence under this section (section. 292).\n\nLeading cases:—Ranjit Udeshi. Samaresh Basu v Amal Mitra. Rajkapoor v Laxman. Mahajan Singh v Commr. of Police.\n2. Selling, letting to hire, distributing, exhibiting, or circulating to any person under the age of 20 years any obscene object referred to above, or attempting to do so (section. 293).\nA book, pamphlet, paper, writing, drawing, painting, representation, figure or any other object is deemed obscene if it is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or if its effect taken as a whole is such as tends to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to see, read or hear the matter.\n3. Causing annoyance to others by—\n\n(a) doing any obscene act in any public place; or\n(b) singing, reciting, or uttering any obscene song, ballad or words, in or near any public place (section 294).\n(4) Keeping any office, or place, for the purpose of drawing any lottery not being a state lottery or a lottery authorised by the State Government (section 294A).\nWhoever publishes any proposal to pay any sum, or to deliver any goods, on drawing of any ticket, lot or number, in a lottery is also punished (ibid). [Fine up to Rs. 100.]\nAn agreement for contributions to be paid by lot, or a transaction requiring skill for winning prizes is not a lottery. Transactions in which prizes are decided by chance amount to lottery.\n\n\n\nOffences relating to religion. Chapter XV.\n\nChapter XV treats of offences relating to religion. They are as follows:—\n\n1. Injuring or defiling a place of worship, or any object held sacred by any class of persons, with intent to insult the religion of any class of persons (section 295).\n2. Deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings of any class, by insulting its religion or religious belief irrespective of the fact whether the religious belief in question is rational or irrational. (section 295A).\n\nLeading cases:—Shalibhadra Shah. Nandkishore Singh. Chandanmal Chopra. T Parameswaran v District Collector.\n3. Voluntarily disturbing a religious assembly lawfully engaged in the performance of religious worship or religious ceremonies (section 296).\n4. Trespassing in a place of worship or burial place, offering any indignity to corpse, or disturbing persons performing funeral ceremonies, with intent to wound the feelings, or insult the religion of any person or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded (section 297).\n5. Uttering any word or making any sound in the hearing of that person, or making any gesture in the sight of that person, or placing any object in the sight of that person (section 298).\n\n\n\nOffences affecting human body. Chapter XVI.\n\nOffences against the person are—\n\n(1) Unlawful homicide.\n(a) Culpable homicide.\n(b) Murder.\n(c) Homicide by rash or negligent act.\n(d) Suicide.\n(e) Being a Thug.\n(2) Causing miscarriage.\n(3) Exposure of infants and concealment of births of children.\n(4) Hurt and grievous hurt.\n(5) Wrongful restraint.\n(6) Wrongful confinement.\n(7) Criminal force.\n(8) Assault. prostitution.\n(9) Kidnapping.\n(10) Abduction.\n(11) Slavery.\n(12) Selling or buying a minor for prostitution.\n(13) Forced labour.\n(14) Rape and other sexual offences.\n(15) Unnatural offence.\n\nCulpable homicide, the genus, and murder, the species, are defined in very close resembling terms.\n\nCulpable homicide.\n\nA person commits murder (section 300) culpable homicide if he causes death by doing an act— (section 299) if he causes death by doing an act—\n\n(1) with the intention of causing death; or\t(1) with the intention of causing death; or\n\n(2) with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(3) with the knowledge that he is likely by such act to cause death.\n\n\n[Imprisonment for life; or 10 years and fine, if the offence comes under clause 2. If it comes under clause 3, then 10 years, or fine, or both— (section 304).]\n(2) \nwith the intention of causing such bodily injury as the offender knows to be likely to cause death of the person to whom the harm is caused; or\n(3) with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is suficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; or\n(4) with the knowledge that it is so imminently dangerous that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.\nCapital punishment, or imprisonment for life, and fine—(section. 302).\n\nAn offence cannot amount to murder unless it falls within the definition of culpable homicide; but it may amount to culpable homicide without amounting to murder. All acts of killing done with the intention to kill, or to inflict bodily injury sufficient to cause death, or with the knowledge that death must be the most probable result are prima facie murder; while those committed with the knowledge that death will be a likely result are culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Where the act is not done \"with the intention of causing death\" (clause 4, section 300) the difference between culpable homicide and murder is merely a question of different degrees of probability that death would ensue. It is culpable homicide where death must have been known to be a probable result. It is murder where it must have been known to be the most probable result. If an injury is deliberately inflicted, in the sense that it is not accidental or unintentional, and the injury, objectively speaking, is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature and death results, the offence is murder (clause 3, section 300).\nLeading cases:—State of AP v R Punnayya. R v Govinda. R v Idu Beg. R v Gora Chand Gopee. Virsa Singh.\nEnglish case.—\"Likely\".—The accused was convicted of an offence of behaving in a manner likely to endanger the safety of an air craft by the persistent use of his mobile telephone in mid-flight. His appeal against conviction failed because the word \"likely\" was correctly construed in its statutory context as meaning \"a real risk not to be ignored.\" (R v White house).\nDeath caused by an act, for example, setting a house on fire, done with foresight that someone may die, but without any intention of that kind, has been held by an English Court to be not murder but only culpable homicide. Foresight is not the same thing as an intention. Foresight may only be an evidence of intention.\nLeading case:—R v Nadrick.\n\nOther circumstances may also prove intention. For example, a married woman burning in the kitchen and her husband and others not at all coming up to her, held by the\n\nSupreme Court to be evidence of intention. Subedar Tewari v State of UP.\n\nWhere death is caused by poison, the earlier legal propositions, one of which required that the accused must be shown to have possessed poison of the kind in question, have now been revised.\nDeath in police custody is not capable by itself of creating an inference of murder. State v Balkrishna.\nLeading case:—Bhupinder Singh v State of Punjab.\n\nDeath caused by the effect of words on the imagination or the passions of a person amounts to culpable homicide. If a person engaged in the commission of an offence causes death by pure accident, he shall suffer only the punishment provided for the offence, without any addition on account of the accidental death. Culpable homicide presupposes an intention, or knowledge of likelihood, of causing death. In the absence of these elements, even if death be caused, the offence will be that of hurt or grievous hurt, e.g., death caused by kicking a person suffering from a diseased spleen.\nA person who causes bodily injury to another who is labouring under a disease or bodily infirmity, and thereby accelerates the death of that other is guilty of homicide (Explanation 1). Similarly, where death is caused by bodily injury, the person who causes such injury is guilty of this offence, although by resorting to proper remedies and skilful treatment death might have been prevented (Explanation 2). The causing of the death of a child in the mother's womb is not homicide. But it is homicide to cause the death of a living child, if any part of that child has been brought forth, though the child may not have breathed or been completely born (Explanation 3).\nIf death is caused by the voluntary act of the deceased resulting from fear of violence on the part of the offender, the offence will be murder. For instance, if four or five persons were to stand round a man, and so threaten him and frighten him as to make him believe that his life was in danger, and he were to back away from them and tumble over a precipice to avoid them, the persons threatening him will be guilty of murder.\nWhere the attack was aimed at one person but it fell upon another resulting in the latter's death, it was held that under the doctrine of transfer of malice, the attacker would be guilty of murder. Nagaraj v State, (2006) Cr LJ 3724 (Mad—FB); Rahimbux v State of MP, (2008) 12 SCC 270 [LNIND 2008 SC 2798] .\nThe punishment for murder is either death or imprisonment for life and also fine. The Supreme Court has, in a long course of decisions, made it an established principle that the normal punishment for murder is life imprisonment and that \"death\" should be awarded in \"rarest of rare cases\". Examples of such rarest of rare cases are:\nLeading cases:—Kehar Singh v State (Delhi Administration). Lichhmadevi v State of Rajasthan.\nAn abnormal delay in executing a death sentence has been recognised as a ground for converting death sentence into life imprisonment.\nLeading cases:—Bachan Singh v State of Punjab Triveniben v State of Gujarat Madhu Mehta v UOI.\nThe Supreme Court has noted serious changes which have taken place in the state of the society since the categories for award of death sentence were laid down. Because of such changes, there should be some flexibility in the application of the categories. Swami Shraddananda v State of Karnataka, (2008) 13 SCC 767 [LNIND 2008 SC 1488] .\n\nThe Supreme Court has also taken opportunities to explain the impact of the special State-wise enactments for punishment of children vis-a-visIPC, 1860: Bhoop Ram v State of UP.\nThere is no difference in the liability of the offender if the injury intended for one falls on another by accident (section 301).\n\n\n\nExceptions.\n\nCulpable homicide is not murder in the following cases:—\n\n\n\nProvocation.\n\n1. Grave and sudden provocation depriving the offender of the power of self-control, provided that the provocation is not—\n(a) sought or voluntarily provoked by the offender as an excuse;\n\n(b) given by anything done in obedience to the law or by a public servant in the lawful exercise of his powers;\n(c) given by anything done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\n\nProvocation resulting from abusive language has been considered to be grave enough. Female infidelity is a common cause of provocation.\nAn English decision allowed even a self-induced provocation to be taken into account for recording a finding of manslaughter: R v Johnson.\nThe longer the gap between the provoking incidents, less likely the defence of provocation is to succeed. The loss of self-control need not be immediate. The mental state of accused at the time of the incident may be taken into account for determining whether the response was the result of the loss of self-control: R v Ahluwalia; Dhandayuthan v State.\n\n\n\nPrivate defence.\n\n2. If the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person or property, exceeds it, and causes death without premeditation and without intending more harm than is necessary.\n\n\n\nPublic servant.\n\n3. If the offender being a public servant or aiding a public servant exceeds his legal powers and causes death by an act which he, in good faith, believes to be lawful and necessary for the due discharge of his duty, and without ill-will towards the deceased.\n\n\n\nSudden fight.\n\n4. If it is committed, without premeditation, in a sudden fight, in the heat of passion, upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage, or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.\nThe fight should not have been pre-arranged.\n\n\n\nConsent.\n\n5. When the deceased, being above the age of 18 years, suffers death or takes the risk of harm with his own consent.\nWhere any of the five exceptions applies, the offence will be punishable under the first part of section 304.\nThe special category of murder enshrined in section 303 under the heading \"punishment for murder by life-convict\" has been declared by the Supreme Court to be unconstitutional.\nLeading case:—Mithu\n\nThe result is that all murders are now punishable under section 302.\n\nCulpable homicide which does not amount to murder is punishable under section 304 for a term extending to 10 years, if the act by which death is caused is done with the intention of causing death or by causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. The same section in its second paragraph, popularly known as Part II, provides that the accused causing death may be punished with imprisonment extending to 10 years or fine or both, if the act is done without intention to cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, but with only knowledge that it is likely to cause death (section 304).\nThe nature of the intention has to be gathered from the kind of weapon used, the part of the body hit, the amount of force employed, and attending circumstances. Manubhai Atabhai v State of Gujarat, (2007) 10 SCC 358 [LNIND 2007 SC 822] .\nFor distinction between section 304 and section 304-A, see Supreme Court decision noted of p 615.\n\n\n\nDeath by negligence.\n\nCausing the death of any person by doing any rash or negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide is punishable (section 304A). [Two years and fine.]\nCriminal rashness is hazarding a dangerous or wanton act with the knowledge that it is so, and that it may cause injury, or knowledge that injury will probably be caused.\nCriminal negligence is acting without the consciousness that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the caution incumbent upon him and that if he had he would have had the consciousness.\nIf death results from injury intentionally inflicted this section does not apply. Death should have been the direct result of the rash and negligent act and that act must be the proximate and efficient cause without the intervention of another's negligence. It must be the causacausans; it is not enough if it is causa sine qua non.\n\nDowry death.\n\nAn unnatural death of a woman within seven years of marriage, whether by burns or injury or otherwise, taking place in the background of cruelty or harassment for dowry, is called a \"dowry death\". Whoever is guilty of causing such death is punishable for a term not less than seven years and which may extend to imprisonment for life. The ingredients of section 304-B offence have been stated by the Supreme Court in Shanti v State of Haryana (section 304-B).\nLeading cases:—R v Nidamarti Nagabhushanam. R v Ketabdi Mundal. Bhalchandra. Syed Akbar.\nThe expression \"soon before\" as occurring in the section has been construed by the Orissa High Court in Keshab Chand Pandit v State, (1995) Cr LJ 175 (Ori), and also by the Supreme Court in Yashoda v State of MP, (2004) 3 SCC 98 [LNIND 2004 SC 155] . Deen Dayal v State of Up, (2009) 11 SCC 157 [LNIND 2009 SC 19] .\nThe Supreme Court has observed that death \"otherwise than in normal circumstances\" would mean that the death was not in the usual course but apparently under suspicious circumstances if it was not caused by burn or bodily injury. Death of a woman by suicide occurring within seven years of marriage cannot be described as occurring in normal circumstances. (Rajayyan). The court has to analyse the facts and circumstances leading to the victim's death to see whether there is proximate connection between the cruelty or harassment for dowry demand and death. State of Rajasthan v Jaggu Ram, (2008) 12 SCC 51 [LNIND 2007 SC 1514] . Kailash v State of MP, (2006) 12 SCC 667 [LNIND 2006 SC 803] ; Dhian Singh v State of Punjab, (2004) 7 SCC\n759 .\n\nSuicide.—There are two provisions regarding abetment of suicide:—\n\n(1) Abetment of suicide of a child or an idiot or an insane or a delirious or an intoxicated person (section 305).\n(2) Abetment of suicide by any person (section 306). There can be abetment of suicide through dowry demand.\n\n\n\nAttempts.\n\nAttempts to destroy life are of three kinds:—\n\n1. Attempt to murder, i.e., doing an act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances that if the doer by that act caused death he would be guilty of murder (section 307). [Ten years and fine. If hurt is caused, then imprisonment for life or 10 years. If the offender is under sentence of imprisonment for life, then death.]\nThe Bombay High Court held that there may be an attempt under section 511 which does not come under this section. It is not intended to exhaust all attempts to commit murder which can be punished under the Code (R v Cassidy). But the Allahabad High Court has laid down that section 511 does not apply to attempts to commit murder which are fully and exclusively provided for by this section (R v Niddha).\nThe Supreme Court held that a person commits an offence under this section when he has an intention to commit murder and in pursuance of that intention he does an act towards its commission irrespective of the fact whether that act is the penultimate act or not (Om Prakash); Samersimbh Umedsinh Rajput v State of Gujarat, (2007) 13 SCC 83 [LNIND 2007 SC 1450] .\n\nLeading case:—State of Maharashtra v Balaram Bama Patil.\n\nIn the matter of suicide by a married woman in the circumstances specified in the amendments, the burden of proving that her in-laws had not abetted the suicide has been put upon them.\nLeading case:—Gurbachan Singh v Satpal Singh. Brij Lal v Prem Chand.\n\nThere must be proof of the fact that the death in question was due to suicide.\n\nLeading case:—Wazir Chand v State of Haryana.\n\n2. Attempt to commit culpable homicide, i.e., doing an act with such intention or knowledge, and under such circumstances, that, if the doer by that act caused death, he would be guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (section 308). [If hurt is caused, then seven years, or fine, or both; in other cases three years, or fine, or both.]\n3. Attempt to commit suicide.— An act towards the commission of this offence should have been done (section 309). [One year, or fine, or both.] The act must have been done in the course of the attempt, otherwise no offence is committed.\nCriminologists feel that an attempt to commit suicide being the manifestation of a diseased condition of mind, this section should be deleted from the Code; as such a person requires sympathy and treatment rather than condemnation and punishment. The Supreme Court ruled that the section was unconstitutional and, therefore, void P Rathinam v UOI. This decision was subsequently reversed by another Supreme Court decision Gian Kaur v State of Punjab. The section is thus back to its honourable position in the Code as a measure to dissuade people from horrifying the society by attempting self-demolition. See also section 115 of the Mental Healthcare Act, 2017, which lays down that notwithstanding anything contained in section 309 of IPC, 1860, any person who attempts to commit suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said Code.\n\n\n\nThug.\n\nA 'thug' is a person who has been\n\n(1) habitually associated with any other or others for the purpose of committing—\n\n(a) robbery, or\n\n(b) child stealing,\n\n(2) by means of, or accompanies with, murder (section 310). [Imprisonment for life and fine (section 311).]\n\n\n\nMiscarriage, exposure of children, etc.\n\nThe following offences relate to birth and exposure of children:—\n\n1. Voluntarily causing a woman with child or quick with child to miscarry, otherwise than in good faith for the purpose of saving the life of the woman (section 312) and without her consent (section 313).\n\nThe Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971, provides for the termination of pregnancy under several other circumstances mentioned in that Act and these sections should now be read subject to those provisions.\n2. Causing the death of a woman by an act done with intent to cause miscarriage (section 314). Jacob George v State of Kerala.\n3. Doing an act without good faith with intent to prevent a child being born or to cause it to die after birth (section 315).\n4. Causing the death of a quick unborn child by an act amounting to culpable homicide (section 316).\n5. Exposure and abandonment of a child under 12 years by parent or persons having care of it (section 317).\n6. Concealment of birth by secret disposal of dead body (section 318).\n\nWhoever causes (1) bodily pain, (2) disease, or (3) infirmity, to any person is said to cause hurt (section 319).\n\n\n\nHurt.\n\nA person voluntarily causes hurt, if he does any act\n\n(a) with the intention of thereby causing hurt to any person, or\n\n(b) with knowledge that he is likely thereby to cause hurt (section 321). [One year, or fine up to Rs. 1,000, or both (section 323).]\nActs which will amount to hurt may amount to assault. But hurt may be caused by many acts which are not assaults, for instance, a person who mixes poison and places it on the table of another, or conceals a scythe in the grass on which another is in the habit of walking, or digs a pit in a road intending that another may fall into it, will be guilty of hurt and not assault.\n\n\n\nGrievous hurt.\n\nThe following kinds of hurt are designated as 'grievous':—\n\n1. Emasculation.\n\n2. Permanent privation of the sight of either eye.\n\n3. Permanent privation of the hearing of either ear.\n\n4. Privation of any member or joint.\n\n5. Destruction or permanent impairing of the powers of any member or joint.\n\n6. Permanent disfiguration of the head or face.\n\n7. Fracture or dislocation of a bone or tooth.\n\n8. Any hurt which endangers life, or which causes the sufferer to be, during the space of 20 days, in severe bodily pain, or unable to follow his ordinary pursuits (section 320).\n\nA seller of arrack who mixed with it a dangerous substance was awarded maximum punishment which was possible under the section. EK Chandrasenan v State of Kerala, AIR 1995 SC 1066 [LNIND 1995 SC 88] .\nVoluntarily causing grievous hurt is voluntarily causing hurt, intending it or knowing it likely to be grievous (section 322). [Imprisonment for seven years and fine (section 325).]\nThe following are aggravated forms of the above two offences:—\n\n1. Voluntarily causing hurt (section 325), or grievous hurt (section 326), by an instrument used for shooting, stabbing, or cutting or which used as a weapon of offence is likely to cause death; or by fire or any heated substance or poison, or any explosive or deleterious substance, or by means of any animal, Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by use of acid (section 326A). [Voluntarily throwing or attempting to throw acid is also made an offence by introducing section 326B.]\n2. Voluntarily causing hurt (section 327), or grievous hurt (section 329), to extort from the sufferer or anyone interested in him, property or valuable security; or to constrain him to do anything illegal; or to facilitate the commission of an offence.\n3. Causing hurt by administering poison or any stupefying, intoxicating, or unwholesome drug, with intent to commit or facilitate the commission of an offence (section 328).\n4. Voluntarily causing hurt (section 330), or grievous hurt (section 331), to extort from the sufferer or anyone interested in him, a confession or any information which may lead to the detection of an offence; or to constrain the restoration of property, or the satisfaction of any claim.\n5. Voluntarily causing hurt (section 332), or grievous hurt (section 333), to a public servant in the discharge of his duty, or to prevent or deter him from so discharging it. Humiliation and abuse of the head master and other teachers of a Government school after entering the premises was held to be covered by the section. Madhudas v State of Rajasthan.\nHurt or grievous hurt caused on grave and sudden provocation is not severely punished (sections 334 and 335). Rash or negligent acts which endanger human life or the personal safety of others are made punishable even though no harm follows (section 336); and if hurt or grievous hurt is caused by such acts the punishment will be more severe (sections 337 and 338).\n\n\n\nWrongful restraint.\n\nWrongful restraint is (1) voluntarily obstructing a person, (2) so as to prevent him from proceeding in any direction, (3) in which he has a right to proceed. There must be the right to proceed Vijay Kumari v SM Rao, (SC). The word \"voluntarily\" connotes direct physical restraint. There should be a restriction on the normal movement of a person. Keki Harmusji Gharda v Mehervan Rustom Irani, (2009) 6 SCC 475 [LNIND 2009 SC 1276] (section 339). [One month, or Rs. 500, or both (section 341).]\nThe slightest unlawful obstruction to the liberty of a person to go lawfully when and where he likes to go is punishable.\n\nWrongful confinement.\n\nWrongful confinement is (1) wrongfully restraining a person, (2) in such a manner as to prevent him from proceeding beyond certain circumscribing limits (section 340). [One year, or Rs. 1,000 or both (section 342).]\nWrongful confinement is a form of wrongful restraint. Wrongful restraint keeps a man out of a place where he wishes to be. Wrongful confinement keeps a man within limits out of which he wishes to go, and has a right to go.\nIn wrongful confinement there must be a total restraint, not a partial one. If a man merely obstructs the passage of another in a particular direction, leaving him at liberty to stay where he is or to go in any other direction if he pleases, he cannot be said thereby to confine him wrongfully. Detention through the exercise of moral force, without the accompaniment of physical force or actual conflict, is sufficient. But there must be voluntary obstruction to the person alleged to be confined so as to prevent him from proceeding in any direction. Malice is not necessary. The period of confinement is immaterial except with reference to punishment.\nLeading cases:—Bird v Jones. Dhania v Clifford. Austin v Dowling.\n\nThe Court can award compensation for false imprisonment in cases where the victim gains his freedom through Court order. Poonam v SI of Police; Paothing v State of Nagaland.\nThe following are aggravated forms of this offence:—\n\n1. Wrongful confinement for three or more days (section 343).\n\n2. Wrongful confinement for ten or more days (section 344).\n\n3. Wrongful confinement of a person knowing that a writ for his liberation has been issued (section 345).\n4. Wrongful confinement is secret so as to indicate an intention that the confinement of such person may not be known to any person interested in that person or to any public servant (section 346).\n5. Wrongful confinement for the purpose of extorting any property or valuable security, or constraining person to do anything illegal or to give any information which may facilitate the commission of an offence (section 347).\n6. Wrongful confinement for the purpose of extorting confession or information which may lead to the detection of an offence, or compelling restoration of any property or valuable security or the satisfaction of any claim or demand (section 348).\n\n\n\nForce.\n\nA person is said to use force to another,\n\n(1) if he causes motion, change of motion, or cessation of motion to that other, or\n\n(2) if he causes to any substance such motion, or change of motion or cessation of motion as brings that substance into contact (a) with any part of that other's body, or\n(b) with anything which that other is wearing or carrying, or (c) with anything so situated that such contact affects that other's sense of feeling; provided that he does so in any of the three following ways:—\n\n(i) By his own bodily power.\n(ii) By disposing any substance in such a manner that the motion or change of motion, or cessation of motion takes place without any further act on his part, or on the part of any other person.\n(iii) By inducing any animal to move, to change its motion, or to cease to move (section 349).\n\n\n\nCriminal force.\n\nA person uses 'criminal force' to another if\n\n(1) he intentionally uses force to any person,\n\n(2) without that person's consent,\n\n(3) in order to the committing of any offence, or\n\n(4) intending by the use of such force to cause, or knowing it to be likely that by the use of such force he will cause, injury, fear, or annoyance to the person to whom the force is used (section 350). [Three months, or Rs. 500, or both.]\n\n\n\nAssault.\n\nA person commits an 'assault', if he\n\n(1) makes any gesture or any preparation,\n\n(2) intending or knowing it to be likely,\n\n(3) that such gesture or preparation will cause any person present to apprehend,\n\n(4) that he is about to use criminal force to that person (section 351). [Three months, Rs. 500, or both (section 352).]\nAn assault is something less than the use of criminal force, the force being cut short before the blow actually falls. An assault is included in every use of criminal force. Mere words do not amount to an assault, but the words which the party threatening uses at the time may give his gestures such a meaning as may make them amount to an assault (Explanation).\nAssault or criminal force on grave provocation is not severely punishable. [One month, or Rs. 200 fine, or both (section 358).] The provocation should not be voluntarily sought, or it should not have been given by anything done in obedience to the law or done by a public servant in the lawful exercise of his powers, or done in the lawful exercise of the right of private defence.\nLeading cases:—Cama v Morgan. Stephen v Myres. Awadesh Mahato.\n\nAn 'assault' differs from an 'affray'—\n\n(1) An 'assault' may take place anywhere, whereas an 'affray' must be committed in a public place.\n\n(2) An 'assault' is regarded as an offence against the person of an individual, whereas an 'affray' is regarded as an offence against the public peace.\nThe following are aggravated forms of the offence of 'assault' and 'use of criminal force':—\n1. Assaulting or using criminal force to deter a public servant from the discharge of his duty (section 353).\n2. Assaulting or using criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty (section 354). The Criminal Law Amendment Act introduced some new offences against women;\n\n(a) Sexual harassment (section 354A)\n(b) Assault or use of criminal force to woman with intent to disrobe (section 354B)\n(c) Voyeurism (section 354C)\n(d) Stalking (section 354D)\n\nKnowledge that modesty is likely to be outraged has been held to be sufficient to constitute the offence without any deliberate intention to do so. Raju Pandurang Mohale v State of Maharashtra, (2004) 4 SCC 371 [LNIND 2004 SC 194] . Police officers committing cruelty upon a woman-worker who came into the police station along with other workers have been held liable to pay her compensation. The Government was ordered to pay out of their salary.\nLeading cases:—People's Union of Democratic Rights v Police Commissioner, Delhi Police; Rupan Deol Bajaj v Kanwar Pal Singh Gill\n3. Assaulting or using criminal force with intent to dishonour a person otherwise than on grave provocation (section 355).\n4. Assaulting or using criminal force in attempting to commit theft of property carried by a person (section 356).\n5. Assaulting or using criminal force to any person, in attempting wrongfully to confine that person (section 357).\n\n\n\nKidnapping.\n\nKidnapping is of two kinds:\n\n(I) Kidnapping from India, and\n\n(II) Kidnapping from lawful guardianship (section 359). [Seven years and fine.]\n\nI. Whoever\n\n(1) conveys any person beyond the limits of India,\n\n(2) without the consent (a) of that person, or (b) of some person legally authorised to consent on behalf of that person,\nis said to kidnap that person from India (section 360).\n\nII. Whoever (a) takes, or (b) entices\n\n(1) any minor (a) under 16 years of age, if a male, or (b) under 18 years of age, if a female, or\n(2) any person of unsound mind,\n\n(3) out of the keeping of the lawful guardian of such minor or person of unsound mind,\n\n(4) without the consent of such guardian,\n\nis said to kidnap such minor or person from lawful guardianship (section 361).\n\nThese sections protect children of tender age from being kidnapped or seduced for immoral purposes, as well as protect the rights of parents and guardians having the custody of minors or insane persons.\nThe persons kidnapped must be taken out of the possession of the parent by any means, forcible or otherwise: and the consent of the person kidnapped does not lessen the offence.\nThe offence of kidnapping is complete when the minor is actually taken from lawful guardianship (R v Nemai Chattoraj; R v Ram Dei; Nanhak Sao v King-Emperor). Kidnapping from guardianship is not a continuing offence.\nIt is no defence that the accused did not know that the person kidnapped was under 18 or believed that she had no guardian. Anyone dealing with such person does so at his peril. The period of detention is immaterial.\nThe circumstance that the act of the accused was not immediate cause of the girl leaving her father's place is no defence if he had at an earlier stage solicited her or induced her to take this step (Varadrajan).\nLeading cases:—T D Vadgama. Sachindra Nath.\n\n\n\nAbducting.\n\nA person is said to 'abduct' another if he\n\n(1) by force compels, or\n\n(2) by any deceitful means induces,\n\nany person to go from any place (section 362). 'Abduction' differs from 'kidnapping'—\n(1) In 'abduction' the removal of the person need not be from the protection of the lawful guardian.\n(2) The element of force or fraud existing in 'abduction' is absent in kidnapping.\n\n(3) In 'abduction' the age of the person abducted is immaterial, in 'kidnapping', the person must be under 16, if a male, and under 18, if a female.\n(4) Abduction is a continuing offence. Kidnapping is not a continuing offence.\n\nThe following are aggravated forms of the offence of 'kidnapping' or 'abducting':—\n\n1. Kidnapping or maiming a minor for purposes of begging (section 363A).\n\n2. Kidnapping or abducting in order to murder (section 364). Badshan v State of UP,\n(2008) 3 SCC 681 [LNIND 2008 SC 310] .\n\n2a. Kidnapping for ransom, etc., (section 364-A) Suman Sood v State of Rajasthan,\n(2007) 5 SCC 634 [LNIND 2007 SC 647] , statement of ingredients.\n\n3. Kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine a person (section 365).\n4. Kidnapping or abducting a woman to compel her to marry any person against her will, or to force or seduce her to illicit intercourse (section 366).\nLeading case:—Ramesh.\n\nPunishment followed where the offence was established by other evidence, though the body of the young widow who was subjected to gang rape was not traceable.\nLeading case:—Arun Kumar v State of UP.\n\n5. Inducing a woman to go from any place, by means of criminal intimidation or abuse of authority or any method of compulsion, in order that she may be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse (ibid).\n6. Inducing a minor girl under the age of 18 years to go from any place or to do any act with the intention or knowledge that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse (section 366A).\n7. Importing a girl under 21 years of age from a foreign country or from the State of Jammu and Kashmir with intent or knowledge that she will be forced or seduced to illicit intercourse (section 366B).\n8. Kidnapping in order to subject a person to grievous hurt, slavery, or unnatural lust (section 367).\n9. Wrongfully concealing or confining a kidnapped or abducted person (section 368).\n\n10. Kidnapping or abducting a child under 10 years with intent to steal movable property from the person of such child (section 369).\nOffences dealing with trafficking\n\n1. Trafficking of person (section 370)\n\n2. Exploitation of a trafficked person (section 370A)\n\n3. Habitually importing, exporting, removing, buying, selling, trafficking or dealing in slaves (section 371).\n\n\n\nSale of minor for immoral purposes.\n\nTwo provisions relate to selling or buying of persons under 18 years of age for immoral purposes:—\n1. Selling, letting to hire, or otherwise disposing of any person under the age of 18 years for the purpose of (a) prostitution, or (b) illicit intercourse, or (c) for any unlawful and immoral purpose, or (d) knowing it to be likely that such person will at any age be used for such a purpose (section 372).\n\n2. Buying, hiring, or otherwise obtaining possession of such person for a like purpose (section 373).\nWhen a girl under 18 years is disposed of to, or is obtained possession of by, a prostitute or a brothel-keeper, the person disposing of or obtaining possession of such girl shall be presumed to have disposed of her or obtained possession of her, for prostitution (Explanation 1, sections 372 and 373).\n\"Illicit intercourse\" means sexual intercourse between persons not united by marriage, or by any union or tie which, though not amounting to a marriage, is recognized by the personal law or custom of the community to which they belong or, where they belong to different communities, of both such communities, as constituting between them a quasimarital relation (Explanation 2, sections 372 and 373).\n\n\n\nUnlawful labour.\n\nUnlawfully compelling any person to labour against his will [One year or fine, or both (section 374).]\n\n\n\nSexual offences\n\nAs introduced by the Criminal law (Amendment Act), 2013—A man is said to commit \"rape\" if he—\n(a) penetrates his penis, to any extent, into the vagina, mouth, urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or\n(b) inserts, to any extent, any object or a part of the body, not being the penis, into the vagina, the urethra or anus of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or\n(c) manipulates any part of the body of a woman so as to cause penetration into the vagina, urethra, anus or any part of body of such woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person; or\n(d) applies his mouth to the vagina, anus, urethra of a woman or makes her to do so with him or any other person,\nunder the circumstances falling under any of the following seven descriptions:—\n\nFirst.—Against her will.\n\nSecond.—Without her consent.\n\nThird.—With her consent, when her consent has been obtained by putting her or any person in whom she is interested, in fear of death or of hurt.\nFourth.—With her consent, when the man knows that he is not her husband and that her consent is given because she believes that he is another roan to whom she is or believes herself to be lawfully married.\nFifth.—With her consent when, at the time of giving such consent, by reason of unsoundness of mind or intoxication or the administration by him personally or through another of any stupefying or unwholesome substance, she is unable to understand the nature and consequences of that to which she gives consent.\n\nSixth.—With or without her consent, when she is under 18 years of age.\n\nSeventh.—When she is unable to communicate consent.\n\nLeading cases:—Rameswar. Bhoginbhai. Raﬁque.\n\nIt is a crime against basic human rights violative of Article 21 of the Constitution. The courts should deal with such offence sternly and severely. The victim's testimony can be acted upon without corroboration in material particulars. Aman Kumar v State of Haryana, (2004) 4 SCC 379 [LNIND 2004 SC 184] .\nFor the purposes of this section, \"vagina\" shall also include labia majora (Explanation- 1). Consent means an unequivocal voluntary agreement when the woman by words, gestures or any form of verbal or non-verbal communication, communicates willingness to participate in the specific sexual act (Explanation-2).\nA medical procedure or intervention shall not constitute rape (Excep.1).\n\nSexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape (Excep. 2). See Independent Thought v UOI, where the Supreme Court held that sexual intercourse with girl below 18 years of age is rape regardless of whether she is married or not. The Supreme Court held that Exception 2 to section 375, IPC, 1860, is to read down as, \"Sexual intercourse or sexual acts by man with his own wife, wife not being 18 years, is not rape\".\nLeading cases:—Balwant Singh v State of Punjab Arun Kumar v State of UP. Promod Mehta v State of Bihar.\nIndecent assault upon a woman does not amount to an attempt to commit rape unless the Court is satisfied that the accused was determined to gratify his passion at all events, and in spite of all resistance.\nLeading case:—Rameshwar(see comments under section 354). Other Rape related offences\nCausing death or resulting in persistent vegetative state of victim (section 376A)\n\nSexual intercourse by husband upon his wife during separation (section 376B) Sexual intercourse by a person in authority (section 376C)\nGang rape (section 376D)\n\nPunishment for repeat offenders (section 376E)\n\nThe circumstances in which the corroboration of the testimony of the victim of a rape would be necessary have been explained by the Supreme Court in State of Maharashtra v CK Jain.\nThe mitigating circumstances which would enable the Court to award less than 10 years' imprisonment have been explained by the Supreme Court in State of Haryana v Prem Chand, with this caution that though the conduct of the prosecutrix in the facts and circumstances of the case may be taken into account, her general character or reputation would neither be an aggravating factor, if good, nor a mitigating factor, if bad.\nThe need for proper identification of the offender and that of promptitude in filing FIR have also been explained.\n\nLeading cases:—Harpal Singh v State of HP; R v Chance.\n\n\n\nUnnatural offence.\n\nUnnatural offence is having (1) carnal intercourse, (2) against the order of nature, (3) with any man, woman or animal (section 377).\nLeading case:—Navtej Singh Johar v UOI (holding that consensual carnal intercourse among adults in private space, does not in any way harm public decency or morality).\n\n\n\nOffences against property. Chapter XVII.\n\nThe following are the offences against property dealt with in Chapter XVII:—\n\n1. Theft.\n2. Extortion.\n3. Robbery.\n4. Dacoity.\n5. Criminal misappropriation of Property.\n6. Criminal Breach of Trust.\n7. Receiving stolen property.\n8. Cheating.\n9. Fraudulent deeds and dispositions of Property.\n10. Mischief.\n11. Criminal trespass.\n\nThe above offences may be grouped in three classes:—\n\n(1) Offences dealing with deprivation of property (sections 378–424).\n\n(2) Offences dealing with injury to property (sections 125–440).\n\n(3) Offences dealing with violation of rights of property in order to the commission of some other offence (sections 441–462).\n\n\n\nTheft.\n\nA person is said to commit theft who\n\n(1) intending to take dishonestly,\n\n(2) any movable property,\n\n(3) out of the possession of any person,\n\n(4) without that person's consent,\n\n(5) moves that property, in order to such taking (section 378). [Three years, or fine, or both (section 379).]\nA thing attached to the earth can be the subject of theft when separated from the earth. A person moving an obstacle which prevented a thing from moving is said to cause it to move. A person causing an animal to move is said to move whatever is thereby moved by the animal. The owner's consent may be express or implied (Explanations).\nThe intention to take dishonestly must exist at the time of the moving of the property. If the act is not done animofurandi, it will not amount to theft. The test is: Is the taking warranted by law? It is not necessary that the taking should be of a permanent character, or that the accused should have derived any profit. Property removed in the assertion of a contested claim does not constitute theft. A bona fide claim of right rebuts the presumption of dishonesty. But a creditor removing a debtor's property to enforce payment is liable. A person taking dishonestly his own property out of the possession of another is guilty of this offence. Thus, the person from whose possession the property is taken may not be the owner. If one of the joint owners takes exclusive possession of joint property dishonestly he would be guilty of theft. The least removal of the thing from its place is sufficient for the offence. It does not matter whether the property remains within its owner's reach or not.\nLeading cases:—Ramratan, K N Mehra, Chandi Kumar v Abanidhar Roy, R v Nagappa, R v Shri Churn Chungo, Ram Ekbal.\nThe following are aggravated forms of the offence:—\n\n1. Theft in any building, tent, or vessel, used as a human dwelling or for the custody of property (section 380).\n2. Theft by a clerk or a servant, of property in possession of his master (section 381).\n\n3. Theft after preparation made for causing death, hurt, or restraint, or fear of death, hurt, or restraint to any person, in order to the committing of such theft or the effecting of such escape afterwards, or the retaining of property taken by such theft (section 382). Knowledge acquired by those who forced their entry into a house that there was only one old man inside and he suffered from a weak heart would be sufficient for conviction, though they left without taking away anything and the man died behind them, his heart giving way.\nLeading case:—R v Watson.\n\n\n\nExtortion\n\nA person commits 'extortion' if he\n\n(1) intentionally puts any person in fear of any injury\n(a) to that person, or\n(b) to any other, and thereby\n(2) dishonestly induces the person so put in fear\n(3) to deliver to any person any\n(a) property, or\n\n(b) valuable security, or\n(c) anything signed or sealed, which may be converted into a valuable security (section 383). [Three years, or fine, or both (section 384).] Putting any person in fear of injury in order to commit extortion [Two years, or fine, or both (section 385).]\nThe inducement to part with the property should be dishonest, i.e., with intent to cause wrongful gain or loss.\nThe 'fear' in extortion must be such as to unsettle the mind of the person on whom it operates and to take away from his acts that element of free voluntary action which alone constitutes consent. The terror of a criminal charge or of loss of an appointment amounts to a fear of injury. 'Fear' must precede the delivery of property. Thus, wrongful retention of property obtained without threat will not amount to extortion, even though subsequent threats are used to retain it.\n'Theft' differs from 'extortion':—\n\n(1) In 'theft' the property is taken without the owner's consent; in 'extortion' the consent is obtained by putting a person in fear of any injury to him or any other. In theft element of force does not arise.\n(2) 'Theft' can only be committed of movable property; 'extortion' may be committed of immovable property as well.\nThe following are aggravated forms of extortion:—\n\n1. Extortion by putting a person in fear of death, or grievous hurt to that person or to any other (section 386).\n2. Putting or attempting to put any person in fear of death, or grievous hurt to himself or any other in order to commit extortion (section 387).\n3. Extortion by threat of accusation of an offence, punishable with death or imprisonment for life, or 10 years' imprisonment, or of having attempted to induce any other person to commit such offence (section 388).\n4. Putting or attempting to put any person in fear of such accusation as is mentioned above in order to commit extortion (section 389).\nRobbery. 'Robbery' is an aggravated form of either theft or extortion. In all 'robbery' there is either theft or extortion.\nTheft is 'robbery' if—\n\n(1) in order to the committing of the theft, or in committing the theft, or\n\n(2) in carrying away, or attempting to carry away, property obtained by the theft,\n\n(3) the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes, or attempts to cause, to any person\n\n(a) death, hurt, or wrongful restraint, or\n(b) fear of instant death, instant hurt, or instant wrongful restraint.\n\nExtortion is 'robbery' if the offender, at the time of committing the extortion, is\n\n(1) in the presence of the person put in fear, and\n\n(2) commits the extortion by putting that person in fear of instant death, instant hurt, or instant wrongful restraint to that person, or to some other person, and\n(3) by so putting in fear, induces the person so put in fear then and there to deliver up the thing extorted (section 390). [Ten years and fine. If the robbery is committed on the highway between sunset and sunrise, then 14 years (section 392). Attempt, seven years and fine (section 393). If hurt is caused, imprisonment for life, or 10 years and fine (section 394).] The offender is said to be present if he is near enough to put the other in fear.\nAn accidental injury by a thief will not convert his offence into robbery. Similarly, if hurt is caused to avoid capture, while retreating without any property, the offence will not amount to robbery, e.g., throwing stones to avoid pursuit.\nBelonging to a wandering gang of persons associated for the purpose of habitually committing theft or robbery is made punishable (section 401).\n\n\n\nDacoity.\n\nWhen (1) five or more persons conjointly commit, or attempt to commit, a robbery, or\n\n(2) where the whole number of persons conjointly committing or attempting to commit, a robbery, and persons present and aiding such commission or attempt amount to five or more, every person so committing, attempting or aiding, is said to commit 'dacoity' (section 391). [Imprisonment for life or 10 years (section 395).]\nIf any one of the dacoits commits murder in committing dacoity, every one of them shall be punished with death, or imprisonment for life, or rigorous imprisonment extending to 10 years and fine (section 396). It does not matter whether a particular dacoit was inside the house where the dacoity was committed, or outside the house, so long as the murder is committed in the commission of the dacoity. It is not necessary that the murder should be committed in the presence of all. It is, however, necessary that murder should be committed in course of the commission of dacoity. Thus, while the dacoits were returning after an attempt to commit dacoity without any booty due to stiff opposition of the villagers and one of the dacoits to facilitate retreat killed one of the villagers by shooting, it was held that as dacoity had ended the moment the dacoits took to their heels without any booty the murder was an individual act of the dacoit who fired the fatal shot and other dacoits could only be held liable for an offence under section 395, IPC, 1860, and not under section 396.\nLeading case:—Shyam Behari.\n\nPreparation to commit dacoity is punishable (section 399). and so is either belonging to a gang of dacoits (section 400), or assembling for the purpose of committing dacoity (section 402).\nAggravated forms of robbery and dacoity are—\n\n(1) Offender using any deadly weapon at the time of committing robbery or dacoity or causing or attempting to cause death or grievous hurt to any person (section 397).\nFor the purpose of this section it is not necessary that the weapon should be actually used. Mere carrying of the weapon causes a psychological sense of insecurity and fear and this would constitute enough use within the meaning of this section.\nLeading case:—Phool Kumar.\n\nThis section only applies to the offender who actually uses a deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt.\n(2) Attempt to commit robbery or dacoity when armed with a deadly weapon (s 398).\n\n\n\nCriminal misappropriation.\n\nA person commits 'criminal misappropriation' if he\n\n(1) dishonestly misappropriates or converts to his own use\n\n(2) any movable property (section 403). [Two years, or fine, or both.]\n\nThe offence is committed though the misappropriation be only temporary. The finder of property is not guilty if he takes it to protect it or to find the owner; but he is guilty, if he appropriates it knowing the owner, or having the means of discovering him, or before using reasonable means to discover him, or not believing it to be his own property, or not believing in good faith that the owner cannot be found (Explanations 1 and 2).\nThis offence takes place when the possession has been innocently come by, but where by a subsequent change of intention, or from the knowledge of some new fact with which the party was not previously acquainted, the retaining becomes wrongful and fraudulent. Thus, retention of money by a servant authorized to collect it from a person may be criminal misappropriation even though he retains it on account of wages due to him.\nA person retaining money paid by mistake will be guilty of criminal misappropriation. But there can be no criminal misappropriation of things which have actually been abandoned.\nLeading cases:—Bhagiram v Abar Dome. R v Sita. Romesh Chunder v Hiru Mondal.\n\n'Theft' is distinguished from 'criminal misappropriation'—\n\n(1) In 'theft' the property is taken out of the possession of another person and the offence is complete as soon as the offender moves the property. In 'criminal misappropriation' there is no invasion of another's possession. The property is often innocently got into possession.\n(2) In 'theft' the dishonest intention must precede the act of taking; in 'criminal misappropriation' it is the subsequent intention to convert or misappropriate the property that constitutes the offence.\nThere is a difference between 'criminal misappropriation' and 'cheating'. In 'criminal misappropriation' as in 'criminal breach of trust', the original reception of property is legal, the dishonest conversion takes place subsequently. In 'cheating' deception is practised to get possession of the thing.\nDishonest misappropriation of property possessed by a deceased person at the time of his death is an offence (section 404).\n\n\n\nCriminal breach of trust.\n\nA person commits 'criminal breach of trust', if he\n\n(1) being in any manner entrusted with (a) property, or (b) any dominion over property;\n\n(2) dishonestly (a) misappropriates, or (b) converts to his own use, that property; or\n\n(3) dishonestly (a) uses, or (b) disposes of, that property;\n\n(4) in violation (a) of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which such trust is to be discharged, or (b) of any legal contract, express or implied, which he has made touching the discharge of such trust; or\n(5) wilfully suffers any other person so to do (section 405). [Three years, or fine, or both (section 406).]\nThe property may be movable or immovable.\n\n'Criminal misappropriation' differs from 'criminal breach of trust'—\n\n(1) In the former the property comes into the possession of the offender by some casualty, and he afterwards misappropriates it; in the latter the offender is lawfully entrusted with property and he dishonestly misappropriates it or wilfully suffers any other person to do so.\n(2) 'Criminal breach of trust' only applies to conversion of property held by a person in a fiduciary capacity; 'criminal misappropriation', to property coming into possession of the offender anyhow.\n(3) 'Criminal misappropriation' can only be of movable property. 'Criminal breach of trust' can be of any property, movable or immovable.\nThe following are aggravated forms of criminal breach of trust:—\n\n1. Criminal breach of trust by a carrier, wharfinger, or warehouse-keeper (section 407).\n\n2. Criminal breach of trust by a clerk or servant (section 408).\n\n3. Criminal breach of trust by a public servant, banker, merchant, factor, broker, attorney or agent (section 409).\nThe Supreme Court has laid down that the offence is not wiped off by reason of the fact that the money in question has been returned or accounted for.\nLeading case:—Viswanath v State of J&K.\n\n\n\nStolen property.\n\n'Stolen property' is—\n\n(1) property the possession whereof has been transferred by (a) theft, (b) extortion, or\n(c) robbery;\n\n(2) property criminally misappropriated;\n\n(3) property in respect of which criminal breach of trust has been committed.\n\nIt is immaterial whether the transfer has been made, or the misappropriation or breach of trust has been committed, within or without India. But if such property subsequently comes into the possession of a person legally entitled to the possession thereof, it ceases to be stolen property (section 410). [Receiving or obtaining stolen property\n\nknowing it to be such is punishable with three years, or fine, or both (section 411).] A person who is found to be in the possession of property shortly after an offence, is presumed to be criminally mixed up with the transaction. The Supreme Court has explained the meaning of the term \"recent possession\" in this connection.\nLeading case:—Earabhadrappa v State of Karnataka.\n\nThis section does not apply to the actual thief when theft is committed in India.\n\nIf stolen goods are restored to the possession of the owner and he returns them to the thief for the purpose of enabling him to sell them to a third person, they are no longer stolen goods; and the third person cannot be convicted of receiving them although he received them knowing them to be stolen.\n'Dishonest retention' of property is distinguished from 'dishonest reception' of it. In the former offence the dishonesty supervenes after the act of acquisition of possession, while in the latter dishonesty is contemporaneous with such act. Thus a person cannot be convicted of 'receiving' if he has no guilty knowledge at the time of receipt. But he is guilty of 'retaining' if he subsequently knows or has reason to believe that the property was stolen. Neither the thief, nor the receiver of stolen property, commits the offence of retaining such property dishonestly merely by continuing to keep possession of it.\nProperty into or for which the stolen property has been converted or exchanged is not stolen property, e.g., proceeds of a stolen cheque, or the change given for a stolen currency-note. But an ingot made out of stolen ornaments still retains it character as stolen property.\nRes nullius cannot be the subject of receiving, e.g., a bull let loose as a part of religious ceremony and belonging to no one is not the subject of theft.\nIf articles belonging to different persons are received at one time, the conviction will be only for one act of receiving and not separate convictions.\nThe following are aggravated forms of this offence:—\n\n1. Dishonestly receiving property stolen in the commission of a dacoity (section 412).\n\n2. Habitually dealing in stolen property (section 413).\n\n3. Voluntarily assisting in concealing or disposing of, or making away with, stolen property (section 414).\n\n\n\nCheating.\n\nA person is said to 'cheat' if he\n\n(1) by deceiving any person;\n\n(2) fraudulently or dishonestly induces the person so deceived;\n\n(3) to deliver any property to any person; or\n\n(4) to consent that any person shall retain any property; or\n\n(5) intentionally induces the person so deceived to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit if he were not deceived; and which\n\n(6) act or omission causes, or is likely to cause, damage or harm to that person in body, mind, reputation, or property (section 415).\nDishonest concealment of facts is a deception (Explanation). [One year, or fine, or both (section 416).]\nLike 'extortion', cheating is committed by the wrongful obtaining of a consent. The difference is that, in the former the consent is obtained by intimidation, in the latter, by deception.\n'Cheating' also differs from 'theft'\n\n(1) In the former the property obtained by deception may be movable or immovable, in the latter, it must be movable.\n(2) In 'theft' the property is taken without the consent of the owner, in 'cheating' the owner's consent is obtained by deception.\nIt is not necessary that cheating should be committed in express words if it can be inferred from all the circumstances attending the obtaining of property. But it is necessary that a person should be deceived. If a person knows what the deception is and acts on it, the person practising deception will be guilty of attempt to cheat but not of cheating. The offence will be committed even if the person deceived is other than the one on whom the deception is practised. Similarly, it is not necessary that there should be an intent to deceive any particular individual. If a false prospectus or balance-sheet is issued to the public, or to a section of the public, the persons issuing it will be guilty of cheating although there was no intent to deceive any one in particular (R v Ross).\nThe person to whom the property is delivered may not be participescriminis. Property obtained by cheating does not fall within the definition of stolen property.\nMere puffing will not amount to this offence (R v Bryan, the Elkington spoon case).\n\nLeading cases:—R v Abbas Ali. R v Appasami. R v Soshi Bhushan. Bashirbhai.\n\nIf the deception is in regard to a future event, then there must be evidence of an intention to cheat when the deception was made. Mere failure to carry out a promise is not enough. A man may intend to fulfil his promise, but subsequently he may change his mind.\nThe following are aggravated forms of cheating:—\n\n1. Cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may thereby be caused to a person whose interest the offender is bound to protect (section 418).\n2. Cheating by personation (sections 416, 419).\n\n3. Cheating and thereby dishonestly inducing the person deceived to deliver any property to any person, or to make, alter, or destroy a valuable security, or anything which is signed or sealed, and which is capable of being converted into a valuable security (section 420). Provisions of the section.\nA person is said to 'cheat by personation' if he cheats\n\n\n\nCheating by personation.\n\n(1) by pretending to be some other person, or\n\n(2) by knowingly substituting one person for another, or\n\n(3) by representing that he or any other person is a person other than he or such other person really is (section 416).\nIt is immaterial whether the individual personated is a real or imaginary person (Explanation). [Three years, or fine or both (section 417).]\nAs soon as a man by words, act, or sign, holds himself out as a particular person with the object of passing himself off as that person, and exercising the right which that person has, he has personated him. For instance, if A represents himself to be B at an examination, or represents himself to be of a particular caste which he is not, or gives a false description of his position in life, he commits this offence.\n\n\n\nFraudulent deeds and dispositions.\n\nThe following provisions relate to fraudulent deeds and dispositions of property:—\n\n1. Dishonest or fraudulent removal or concealment or transfer of property to prevent distribution among creditors (section 421).\n2. Dishonestly or fraudulently preventing from being made available for creditors a debt or demand due to the offender or to any other person (section 422).\n3. Dishonestly or fraudulently signing, executing or becoming a party to any instrument which purports to transfer or charge any property and which contains any false statement as to the consideration for such transfer or charge or as to the person or persons for whose benefit it is intended to operate (section 423).\n4. Dishonestly or fraudulently concealing or removing any property of the offender or of any other person or assisting in the concealment, or removal thereof, or dishonestly releasing any demand or claim to which the offender is entitled (section 424).\nA person commits 'mischief' if he\n\n\n\nMischief.\n\n(1) with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to (a) the public or (b) any person;\n(2) causes (a) the destruction of any property, or (b) any such change in any property, or in the situation thereof, as destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously (section 425).\nThe offender need not intend loss or damage to the owner. The property may belong to the offender, or to him jointly with others (Explanation). [Three months, or fine or both (section 426).]\nA man may commit mischief on his own property to cause wrongful loss to some person. If a person does any act amounting to mischief in the exercise of a bona fide claim or right he cannot be convicted of this offence. An act done through negligence will never amount to mischief. Mischief cannot be committed in respect of a res nullius, e.g., killing a bull which was set free.\n\nThe aggravated forms of mischief are as follows:—\n\n1. Committing mischief, and thereby causing damage to the amount of Rs. 50 (section 427).\n2. Mischief by killing, poisoning, rendering useless, or maiming any animal of the value of Rs. 10 (section 428).\n3. Mischief by killing, poisoning, maiming or rendering useless any elephant, camel, horse, mule, buffalo, bull, cow or ox or any other animal of the value of Rs. 50 or upwards (section 429).\nThis offence is similar to that created under section 50 of the Wild Life Protection Act, 1972. The two enactments are, therefore, not likely to attract the doctrine of double jeopardy.\nLeading case:—State of Bihar v Murad Ali Khan.\n\n4. Mischief by injury to works of irrigation or by wrongfully diminishing the supply of water for agricultural purposes or for food, or drink, or cleanliness (section 430).\n5. Mischief by injury to public road, bridge, river or channel, so as to render it impassable or less safe for travelling or conveying property (section 431).\n6. Mischief by causing inundation or obstruction to public drainage attended with damage (section 432).\n7. Mischief by destroying, or moving or rendering less useful a light house or sea-mark or by exhibiting false lights (section 433).\n8. Mischief by destroying, moving, or rendering less useful any land-mark fixed by the authority of a public servant (section 434).\n9. Mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage to the amount of Rs. 100 or upwards or where the property is agricultural produce—Rs. 10 or upwards (section 435).\n10. Mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy any building used as a place of worship, or human dwelling, or as a place for the custody of property (s. 436).\nWhat is a new development under the section, the Madras High Court allowed public interest litigation under the section and compelled the State to pay compensation to the victims of a riot to whom the State did not provide any protection at the material time nor prosecuted the offenders afterwards.\nLeading case:—R Gandhi v UOI.\n\n11. Mischief with intent to destroy or make unsafe a decked vessel or a vessel of 20 tons burden (section 437).\n12. Mischief or attempt to commit mischief with fire or any explosive substance (section 438).\n13. Intentionally running a vessel aground or ashore with intent to commit theft or misappropriation of property (section 439).\n14. Mischief committed after preparation made for causing to any person death, hurt, or wrongfully restraint, or fear of death, hurt, or wrongful restraint (section 440).\nA person commits 'criminal trespass' if he\n\nCriminal trespass.\n\n(1) enters into or upon property in the possession of another;\n\n(2) with intent to commit an offence; or\n\n(3) to intimidate, insult, or annoy any person in possession of such property; or\n\n(4) having lawfully entered into or upon such property unlawfully remains there;\n\n(a) with intent to intimidate, insult, or annoy any such person, or\n\n(b) with intent to commit an offence (section 441). [Three months or Rs. 500, or both (section 447).]\nTrespass can only be committed in respect of corporeal property. The essence of the offence is the intention with which it is committed. The causing of such annoyance, intimidation or insult must be the main aim of the entry (Mathri). It is not necessary that the intention must be to annoy a person who is actually present at the time of the trespass (Rash Behari). A person entering on the land of another in the exercise of a bona fide claim of right will not be guilty though the claim is unfounded. But if the entry is made with intent to annoy it does not matter whether it was made under a claim of right. The annoyance must be such as would affect an ordinary man, not what would specially and exclusively annoy a particular individual of a queer temperament.\nThe property must be in the actual possession of a person other than the trespasser. It is de facto and not de jure possession that is necessary. The person in possession may be an individual or a corporate person.\nThe entry must be to commit an offence as defined in section 40, and not any unlawful act. Thus entering an exhibition building without a ticket does not amount to criminal trespass. Slum dwellers upon public land cannot be equated with a trespasser under these sections. Their action has been described by the Supreme Court to be not voluntary, but one due to compulsion of circumstances.\nLeading case:—Olga Tellis v Bombay MC.\n\n\n\nHouse-trespass.\n\nA person commits 'house-trespass' if he\n\n(1) commits criminal trespass\n(2) by entering into, or remaining in\n(a) any building, tent, or vessel used as a human dwelling, or\n(b) any building\n(i) used as a place of worship, or\n(ii) as a place for the custody of property (section 442).\n\nIntroduction of any part of the trespasser's body is sufficient (Explanation). [One year, or Rs. 1,000, or both (section 448).]\nThe following are aggravated forms of this offence:—\n\n1. House-trespass in order to the commission of an offence punishable with death (section 449).\n2. House-trespass in order to the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment for life (section 450).\n3. House-trespass in order to the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment (section 451).\n4. House-trespass after preparation made for causing hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint to any person, or for putting any person in fear of hurt, assault, or wrongful restraint (section 452).\n\n\n\nLurking house-trespass.\n\n'Lurking house-trespass' is house-trespass, after taking precautions to conceal such house-trespass from some person who has a right to exclude or eject the trespasser from the building, tent, or vessel which is the subject of the trespass (section 443). [Two years and fine (s. 453).]\nWhoever commits lurking house-trespass after sunset and before sunrise is said to commit 'lurking house-trespass' by night (section 444). [Three years and fine (section 456).]\n\n\n\nHouse-breaking.\n\nA person is said to commit 'house-breaking' if he\n\n(a) commits house-trespass, and effects his entrance into the house, or\n\n(b) if being in the house for committing an offence, or after committing an offence,\nquits it in any of the following ways—\n\n(1) Through a passage made by himself, or by any abettor of the house-trespass, in order to the committing of the house-trespass.\n(2) Through any passage not intended by any person other than himself, or an abettor of the offence, for human entrance, or through any passage to which he has obtained access by scaling or climbing over any wall or building.\n(3) Through any passage which he, or any abettor of the house-trespass, has opened, in order to the committing of the house-trespass by any means by which that passage was not intended by the occupier of the house to be opened.\n(4) By opening any lock.\n\n(5) By using criminal force, or committing an assault, or by threatening any person with assault.\n(6) By any passage which he knows to have been fastened against such entrance or departure, and to have been unfastened by himself, or by an abettor of the house- trespass (section 445). [Two years and fine (section 453).]\nHouse-breaking after sunset and before sunrise is said to be 'house-breaking by night' (section 466). [Three years and fine (section 456).]\n\nThe following are aggravated forms of the offence of lurking house-trespass and housebreaking:—\n1. Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking in order to the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment (section 454).\n2. Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking after preparation made for causing hurt to any person (section 455).\n3. Causing grievous hurt or attempting to cause death or grievous hurt to any person whilst committing lurking house-trespass or house-breaking (section 459).\nThe following are aggravated forms of the offence of 'lurking house-trespass by night' and 'house-breaking by night':—\n1. Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night in order to the commission of an offence punishable with imprisonment (section 457).\n2. Lurking house-trespass or house-breaking by night, after preparation made for causing hurt to any person (section 458).\nAll persons jointly concerned in lurking house- trespass or house-breaking by night are punishable where death or grievous hurt is caused by one of them (section 460).\nDishonestly breaking open a receptacle containing property is punishable (section 461). The punishment is much more severe when such act is committed by a person who is entrusted with its custody (section 462).\nChapter XVIII deals with offences relating to documents and to property marks. A person commits forgery if he\n\n\nForgery. Chapter XVIII.\n\n(1) makes any false document, or part of a document,\n\n(2) with intent\n\n(a) to cause damage or injury to the public or to any person, or\n\n(b) to support any claim or title, or\n\n(c) to cause any person to part with property, or\n\n(d) to enter into any express or implied contract, or\n\n(e) to commit fraud, or that fraud may be committed (section 463).\n\n[Three years, or fine or both (section 465).] Using as genuine a forged document is punishable likewise (section 471).\nA person is said to make a false document—\n\nI. If he dishonestly or fraudulently (a) makes, signs, seals, or executes a document,\n\n(b) with the intention of causing it to be believed that such document or part of a document was made, signed, sealed or executed\n\n(i) by, or by the authority of a person by whom, or by whose authority he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, or executed, or\n(ii) at the time at which he knows that it was not made, signed, sealed, or executed. Or\nII. If he dishonestly, or fraudulently, without lawful authority by cancellation or otherwise,\n\n(a) alters a document in any material part thereof,\n(b) after it has been made or executed either by himself, or by any other person, whether such person be living, or dead at the time of such alteration. Or\nIII. If he dishonestly or fraudulently causes any person to sign, seal, execute, or alter a document, knowing that such person\n\n(a) by reason of unsoundness of mind, or intoxication cannot, or\n(b) by reason of deception practised upon him, does not, know the contents of the document, or the nature of the alteration (section 464).\nA man's signature of his own name may amount to forgery (Explanation 1). But this must have been done in order that it may be mistaken for the signature of another person of the same name. Making a false document in the name of a fictitious person intending it to be believed that the document was made by a real person, or in the name of a deceased person intending it to be believed that the document was made by that person in his lifetime may amount to forgery (Explanation 2). A false document made wholly or in part by forgery is designated 'a forged document' (section 470).\nIt is not an essential quality of the fraud mentioned in the section that it should result in or aim at deprivation of property. The offence is complete as soon as a document is made with intent to commit a fraud. But the false document must appear on its face to be one which, if true, would possess some legal validity or must be legally capable of effecting the fraud intended. A writing, though not legal evidence of the matter expressed, may yet be a document if the parties framing it believed and intended it to be evidence of such matter. It is not necessary that the document should be made in the name of a really existing person.\nCounterfeiting a document to support a legal claim will amount to forgery. Antedating a document or inserting a false date in it constitutes forgery.\nA general intention to defraud, without the intention of causing wrongful gain or loss to any particular person, is sufficient. There must, however, be a possibility of some person being defrauded. A man may have an intent to defraud and yet there may not be any person who could be defrauded by his act.\nIf several persons combine to forge an instrument and each takes a distinct part in it, they are nevertheless all guilty.\nIt will amount to forgery even though the fabricated document purports to be a copy of another document.\nPersonation at an examination will amount to forgery as well as cheating.\n\nLeading cases:—R v Abbas Ali. R v Lalit Mohan. R v Shoshi Bhushan. R v Kotamraju. Harnam Singh.\n\nA document made to conceal a previous fraudulent or dishonest act amounts to forgery. But such falsification is not forgery if it is only for the purpose of concealing a previous negligent act.\nThe following are aggravated forms of the offence of forgery:—\n\n1. Forgery of a record of a Court of Justice or of a register of births, baptism, marriage or burial, or a certificate or authority to institute or defend a suit or a power of attorney (section 464).\n2. Forgery of a valuable security or will (section 467).\n\n3. Forgery for the purpose of cheating (section 468).\n\n4. Forgery for the purpose of harming the reputation of any person (section 469).\n\nOther offences relating to documents are:—\n\n1. Making or possessing a counterfeit seal, plate, etc., with intent to commit forgery punishable under section 467 (section 472).\n2. Same as above when punishable otherwise (section 473).\n\n3. Possession of a valuable security or will, known to be forged, with intent to use it as genuine (section 474).\n4. Counterfeiting a device or mark used for authenticating any document described in\nsection 467, or possessing counterfeit marked material (section 475).\n\n5. Same as above when the documents are other than those described in section 467 (section 476).\n6. Fraudulent cancellation, destruction, defacement or secreting, etc., of a will or an authority, to adopt, or a valuable security (section 477).\n7. Falsification of accounts by a clerk or officer or servant with intent to defraud (section 477A).\n\n\n\nProperty-mark.\n\nA mark used for denoting that movable property belongs to a particular person is called a 'property-mark' (section 479).\nA person uses a false property-mark\n\n(1) if he marks any movable property or goods, or any case, package, or other receptacle containing movable property or goods; or\n(2) uses any case, package or other receptacle, having any marks thereon;\n\n(3) in a manner reasonably calculated to cause it to be believed that the property or goods contained in any such receptacle so marked, belong to a person to whom they do not belong (section 481). [One year, or fine, or both (section 482).]\nThe function of a property-mark to denote certain ownership is not destroyed because any particular property on which it is impressed ceases to be of that ownership.\n\nWhile trade-mark denotes the manufacture of quality of the goods to which it is attached, property-mark, the ownership of them.\nThe following offences relate to counterfeiting any property-mark used by a person:—\n\n1. Counterfeiting any property-mark used by another (section 483).\n\n2. Counterfeiting a mark used by a public servant to denote that any property has been manufactured by a particular person or at a particular time or place or that property is of a particular quality or has passed through a particular office or that it is entitled to any exemption (section 484).\n3. Making or possession of any instrument for counterfeiting a property-mark (section 485).\n4. Selling or exposing or possessing for sale or any purpose of trade or manufacture any goods or things with a counterfeit property-mark (section 486).\n5. Making a false mark upon any receptacle containing goods (unless without intent to defraud) (section 487).\n6. Making use of any false mark (unless without intent to defraud) (section 488).\n\n7. Tampering with property-mark with intent to cause injury (section 489).\n\nThere are five offences relating to currency-notes and bank-notes.—\n\n\n\nCurrency-notes and bank-notes.\n\n1. Counterfeiting currency-notes or bank-notes (section 489A)\n\n2. Selling, buying, or using as genuine forged or counterfeit currency-notes or bank- notes knowing the same to be forged or counterfeit (section 489B).\n3. Possession of forged or counterfeit currency-notes or bank-notes, knowing or having reason to believe the same to be forged or counterfeit and intending to use the same as genuine (section 489C). Possession and knowledge that the currency notes in question were counterfeit are both necessary. The section is not confined to Indian currency notes alone. K Hashim v State of TN, (2005) 1 SCC 237 [LNIND 2004 SC 1142]\n.\n\n4. Making or possessing instruments or materials for forging or counterfeiting currency-notes or bank-notes (section 489D). It is not necessary that the machinery for counterfeiting found in possession of the accused should be the whole set required for counterfeiting. K Hashim v State of TN, (2005) 1 SCC 237 [LNIND 2004 SC 1142] .\n5. Making or using documents resembling currency-notes or bank-notes (section 489E).\nThe expression \"currency-notes\" or \"bank-notes\" would include such notes of a foreign country. In other words, foreign currency would also be within the mischief of these provisions.\nLeading case:—State of Kerala v Mathai Verghese, (1986) 4 SCC 746 [LNIND 1986 SC 461] .\n\nContract of service. Chapter XIX.\n\nChapter XIX treats of criminal breach of contracts of service.\n\nThe only case in which the Code now punishes a breach of contract is the following:—\n\nVoluntarily omitting to perform a lawful contract to attend on or supply the wants of a child, or an insane or a sick person, who is incapable of providing for his own safety or of supplying his own wants (section 491). [Three months, or Rs. 200, or both.]\nOrdinary servants, such as cooks, do not come within the purview of this section.\n\n\n\nMarriage. Chapter XX.\n\nChapter XX deals with offences relating to marriage.\n\nThe following two provisions relate to mock or invalid marriages:—\n\n1. Cohabitation caused by a man deceitfully inducing a belief of lawful marriage (section 493). [Ten years and fine.]\n2. Dishonestly or fraudulently going through a marriage ceremony knowing that no lawful marriage is thereby created (section 496). [Seven years and fine.]\nThe latter offence differs from the former in the fact that in it the ceremony is gone through, which is valid on the face of it but invalid for some reason known to one party, or the other. The former section applies to deception practised by a man on a woman; the latter applies to an offence by a man as well as by a woman.\n\n\n\nBigamy.\n\nA person commits 'bigamy' if that person\n\n(1) having a husband or a wife living,\n\n(2) marries in any case in which such marriage is void,\n\n(3) by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife (section 494). [Seven years and fine.] If the former marriage is concealed from the person with whom the subsequent marriage is contracted, the punishment is ten years and fine (section 495).\nThere are two exceptions in which the second marriage is not an offence—\n\n(1) When the first marriage has been declared void by a Court of competent jurisdiction.\n(2) When the husband or wife has been continually absent or not heard of for seven years, provided that this fact be disclosed to the person with whom the second marriage is contracted.\nThis section applies to Mohammedan women but not to men of that community and to Hindus, Christians and Parsis of either sex.\n\nThe first marriage must be a valid marriage. But a Mohammedan girl has the option, if Shia, to ratify, or if Sunni, to cancel, her marriage on reaching the age of puberty if a person other than her father or grand-father had given her in marriage.\nIf the marriage is not a valid marriage according to the law applicable to the parties, no question of its being void by reason of its taking place during the life time of the husband or the wife of the person arises and this section does not apply. Admission of marriage by the accused is not evidence of it in a bigamy case; the second marriage as a fact and the essential ceremonies constituting it, must be proved. The Courts are not now so emphatic about proof of ceremonies. Indu Bhagya Natekar v BP Natekar.\nConversion of a Hindu wife to Mohammedanism or Christianity does not dissolve her marriage with her Hindu husband and if she marries a Mohammedan or a Christian she commits bigamy.\nLeading cases:—R v Ram Kumari, R v Ganga; R v Millard; Bhaurao Shankar, Kanwal Ram.\n\nIt appears, however, that a Christian cannot by embracing Mohammedanism marry a second time during the lifetime of his first wife. He cannot cast off to the winds a contractual obligation by his own act.\nThe rigour of the second exception was somewhat modified in Tolson's case, which lays down that if the second marriage takes place within seven years under a bona fide belief based on reasonable grounds that the former consort was dead, no offence would be committed.\n\n\n\nAdultery.\n\nA person commits adultery, if he\n\n(1) has sexual intercourse with a person,\n\n(2) whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man,\n\n(3) without the consent or connivance of that man,\n\n(4) such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape (section 497). [Five years, or fine, or both.]\nLeading case:—Joseph Shine v UOI (holding section 497 unconstitutional).\n\nTaking or enticing away or concealing or detaining a woman, knowing or having reason to believe her to be married, from her husband, in order that she may have illicit intercourse with any man is punishable (section 498). [Two years, or fine, or both.]\nCruelty to married woman.—Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty is liable to be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine (section 498A). This Chapter [Chapter XX-A] and the section have given a new dimension to the concept of cruelty for the purposes of matrimonial remedies and the type of conduct described in the section will be relevant for proving cruelty. Consequence of cruelty which was likely to drive a woman to commit suicide or to cause grave injury or danger to life or limb or health, whether mental or physical, have to be shown for attracting the section. Noorjahan v State, (2008) 11 SCC 55 [LNIND 2008 SC 950] . The basic ingredients of section 498A are cruelty and harassment. Undavalli Narayana Rao v State of AP, (2009) 14 SCC 588 [LNIND 2009 SC 1515] .\n\nLeading case:—Wazir Chand v State of Haryana.\n\nThis section has been introduced by Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act 46 of 1983) to combat the vice of dowry deaths. By the same Act section 113A has been added to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which enables the Court to draw a presumption regarding abetment of suicide by a married woman if she commits suicide within seven years of her marriage and it is shown that her husband or relative had subjected her to cruelty. A mere demand for dowry is an offence.\nIllustrations on the meaning of harassment have been brought in from cases decided under the [English] Protection From Harassment Act, 1997. The various types of conduct which may constitute cruelty has been judicially construed.\n\n\n\nDefamation. Chapter XXI.\n\nA person is guilty of 'defamation' if he,\n\n(1) by words, either (a) spoken, or (b) intended to be read; or\n\n(2) by signs or visible representations;\n\n(3) makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person;\n\n(4) intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person (section 499). [Two years simple, or fine, both (section 500).]\nDefamation may be of a deceased person (Explanation 1). It may be concerning a company, an association, or collection of persons (Explanation 2). It may be by ironical expressions. It is however necessary to show that this collection of persons is a small determinate body whose identity can be fixed. Advocates as a class cannot therefore be defamed.\nThe fact of reference to a particular person may be proved by means of the technique of \"innuendo\".\nLeading cases:—Manmohan Kalia v Yash. Asha Parekh v State of Bihar.\n\nAn imputation harms a person's reputation which, in the estimation of others, directly or indirectly, either\n(1) lowers his moral or intellectual character; or\n\n(2) lowers his character in respect of his caste or calling, or his credit; or\n\n(3) causes it to be believed that his body is in a loathsome state, or in a state generally considered disgraceful (Explanation 4).\nThe definition in the Code applies to words as well as writings.\n\nThe IPC, 1860, makes no distinction between spoken and written defamation.\n\nThe defamatory matter must be published, i.e., communicated to a person other than the one defamed. The person who makes the imputation intending to harm the reputation of another, as well as the person who publishes it are alike guilty. The publisher need not be the maker of the defamatory matter.\n\nThe publisher of a newspaper is responsible for defamatory matter appearing in the newspaper whether he knows it or not. But it will be a good justification to plead if such matter is published in his absence and without his knowledge and the temporary management of the paper was in competent hands. A newspaper published at one place and sent to a subscriber at another will be considered to have been published at the latter place.\n\n\n\nExceptions.\n\nAny of the following defences may be set up against a charge of defamation:—\n\n1. Imputation of any truth which the public good requires to be made or published.\n\n2. Opinion expressed in good faith respecting the conduct of a public servant in the discharge of his duties, or his character so far as it appears in that conduct.\n3. Opinion expressed in good faith respecting the conduct of any person touching a public question, or his character so far as it appears in that conduct.\n4. Publication of a substantially true report of the proceedings of a court.\n\nSuch report cannot be published if the court has prohibited it, or where the subject- matter of the trial is obscene or blasphemous.\n5. Opinion expressed in good faith respecting the merits of a case decided in a court; or the conduct of a party, witness or agent concerned therein; or the character of such person so far as it appears in such conduct.\n6. Opinion expressed in good faith respecting the merits of a performance submitted by the author to public judgment; or respecting the author's character so far as it appears in such a performance.\n7. Censure passed in good faith by a person having lawful authority over another.\n\n8. Accusation preferred in good faith to a duly authorized person.\n\n9. Imputation made in good faith by a person for the protection of his interest, or of any other person, or for the public good.\nThe privilege of judges, counsels, pleaders, witnesses, and parties comes under this exception. So also, as to statements made in pleadings and reports to superior officers.\nJUDGE.—A Judge cannot be prosecuted for defamation for words used by him whilst trying a case in court even though such words are alleged to be false, malicious, and without reasonable cause (Rama v Subramanya).\nCOUNSEL OR PLEADER.—The Madras High Court held in Sullivan v Norton that no proceedings can be instituted against a counsel or pleader for uttering words that are defamatory, or are calculated to hurt the feelings of others, or are absolutely devoid of all solid foundation. This case has been doubted in a much later decision in which it was held that in the case of a lawyer good faith is to be presumed until bad faith is proved by proof of private malice when the Court will interfere (Mir Anwarrudin v Fathim Bai).\nThe Bombay High Court has held that so long as an advocate acts on his client's instructions, he has the fullest liberty of speech provided that he did not know or could\n\nnot know that they were false. (Bhaishankar v Wadia). Where express malice is absent the advocate or pleader is protected (Re Nagarji; Purshottamdas).\nThe Calcutta High Court has held that advocates have no absolute privilege. But unless a counsel or pleader is actuated by improper motives he is protected. If bad faith is proved in putting questions to witnesses he is liable. There must be evidence that he was actuated by improper motives and not by a desire to further his client's interest.\nThe Patna High Court has held that the privilege is not absolute but qualified and the burden is on the prosecution to prove absence of good faith.\nWITNESS.—The Bombay High Court has held in a Full Bench case that relevant statements made by a witness on oath or solemn affirmation in a judicial proceeding are not absolutely privileged on a prosecution for defamation, but are governed by the provisions of this section (Bai Shanta v Umrao).\nThe Calcutta High Court has laid down that such statements should be relevant to the inquiry (Woolfun Bibi v Jerasat Sheikh). If a witness voluntarily makes defamatory statements he will be guilty (Haider Ali v Abru Mia).\nThe Madras High Court is of opinion that statements of a witness made in the witness- box are absolutely privileged. If they are false the remedy is by indictment for perjury, and not for defamation (Manjaya v Shesha Shetti).\nThe Allahabad High Court has held in a Full Bench case that a witness can be prosecuted for defamatory statements concerning a person unless he shows that the statements fall under one of the exceptions to this section (Ganga Prasad).\nThe former Chief Court of the Punjab had adopted the view of the Calcutta and the Allahabad High Courts.\nThe former Nagpur High Court had followed the Bombay, the Calcutta and the Allahabad High Courts and held that a witness is not entitled to absolute privilege (Chotelal's case).\nPARTY.—The Bombay High Court has held that relevant statements made by an accused are not absolutely protected, but are governed by the provisions of section 499(Bai Shanta v Umrao).\nThe Madras High Court has held that if an accused puts any question while defending himself, the question cannot be made the subject of a prosecution for defamation (Hayes v Christian). Statement in answer to a question by the Court is not absolutely privileged (Tiruvengada Mudali's case). If a defamatory statement is made before an officer who is neither a judicial officer nor a court, e.g., a Registration Officer, such a statement is not absolutely privileged. (Krishnammal's case).\nThe Calcutta High Court has ruled in a Full Bench case that a defamatory statement on oath by a party falls within section 499 and is not absolutely privileged (Satish Chandra Chakravarti v Ram Doyal De).\nThe Allahabad High Court holds the view that a suitor is not absolutely privileged.\n\nPLEADING.—Defamatory statements in applications, pleadings and affidavits are not absolutely privileged.\nThe Bombay High Court has held that statements made in a written statement filed by the accused are not absolutely privileged. According to the Allahabad High Court any statement made in an application in good faith is protected.\n\nThe Calcutta and the Patna High Courts have held that defamatory statements in a plaint or an affidavit are not absolutely privileged. But the decisions of the Calcutta High Court are not unanimous on the point whether statements in a complaint to a Magistrate are absolutely privileged or not.\nThe Madras High Court has in a Full Bench case held that a defamatory statement in a complaint to a Magistrate is not absolutely privileged. (Triuvengada Mudali's case).\nThe former Chief Court of the Punjab had laid down that such statements were not absolutely privileged.\n10. Caution intended in good faith for the good of the person to whom it is conveyed or of some person in whom he is interested, or for public good.\n\n\n\nOther offences.\n\nThe following acts also are made punishable:—\n\n1. Printing or engraving matter known to be defamatory (section 501).\n\n2. Sale of printed or engraved substance containing defamatory matter (section 502).\n\n\n\nCriminal intimidation. Chapter XXII.\n\nA person commits 'criminal intimidation' if he\n\n(1) threatens another with any injury\n\n(a) to his person, reputation or property, or\n\n(b) to the person, or reputation of any one in whom that person is interested,\n\n(2) with intent\n\n(a) to cause alarm to that person, or\n\n(b) to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do,\n(3) as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat (section 503). [Two years, or fine, or both.]\nIf the threat be to cause (1) death or grievous hurt, (2) the destruction of any property by fire, (3) an offence punishable with death, imprisonment for life, or seven years' imprisonment, then seven years, or fine, or both (section 506). [If intimidation is caused by an anonymous communication, then additional imprisonment for two years (section 507).]\n'Criminal intimidation' is closely analogous to 'extortion.' In the former the immediate purpose is to induce the person threatened to do, or abstain from doing, something which he was not legally bound to do or omit; in the latter, the purpose is getting filthy lucre by obtaining property. In 'criminal intimidation' the threat need not produce the effect aimed at nor should it be addressed directly to the person intended to be influenced. If it reaches his ears anyhow the offence is complete.\n\nThe following two provisions relate to insult offered to persons other than public servants—\n\n\n\nInsult.\n\n(1) Intentional insult with intent to provoke a breach of the peace, or to cause the commission of any offence. (section 504).\n(2) Uttering any word, or making any sound or gesture, or exhibiting any object, intending to insult the modesty of a woman or intruding upon the privacy of a woman (section 509).\n\n\n\nStatement conducing to public mischief.\n\nMaking, publishing or circulating, any statement, rumour, or report\n\n(1) with intent to cause any officer, soldier, sailor or airman in the Army, Navy or Air Force, to mutiny, or to disregard or fail in his duty, or\n(2) with intent to cause fear or alarm to the public whereby any person may be induced to commit an offence against the State or public tranquillity, or\n(3) with intent to incite any class of persons to commit any offence against any other class is made punishable (section 505). [Three years, or fine, or both.] The offence is not committed if such statement, etc., is true and there is no such intent as aforesaid.\nMaking, publishing or circulating, any statement or report containing alarming news\n\n(1) with intent to create or promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill will between different groups or communities on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, caste or community (section 505). [Three years, or fine, or both.]\n(2) Aggravated form of the same offence when committed in any place of worship or in any assembly engaged in religious ceremonies (section 505). [Five years and fine.]\n\n\n\nDivine displeasure.\n\nAct or omission caused by inducing a person to believe that he will be rendered an object of Divine displeasure if he does not do or omit to do the things which it is the object of the offender to cause him to do or omit, is punishable (section 508). [One year, or fine, or both.]\n\n\n\nIntoxication.\n\nIntoxication alone is not made punishable by the Code. But a person who in a state of intoxication appears in any public place, or in any place which it is a trespass in him to enter, and there conducts himself in such a manner as to cause annoyance to any person is liable to punishment (section 510). [24 hours, or Rs. 10, or both.]\n\nAttempts. Chapter XXVIII.\n\nThe last chapter deals with attempts to commit offences. Attempting to commit or causing to be committed an offence, punishable by the Code with imprisonment for life or imprisonment, and in such attempt doing any act towards the commission of the offence is—where there is no express provision for the punishment of such attempt— punishable with imprisonment provided for the offence, for a term which may extend to one-half of the imprisonment for life or one-half of the longest term of imprisonment provided for that offence, or with such fine as is provided for the offence, or with both (section 511).\nEvery commission of a crime has three stages—\n\n(1) intention to commit it;\n\n(2) preparation for its commission; and\n\n(3) a successful attempt.\n\nMere intention to commit a crime, not followed by any act, does not constitute an offence. The will is not to be taken for the deed unless there be some external act which shows that progress has been made in the direction of it or towards maturing and effecting it.\nPreparation consists in devising means for the commission of an offence. The section does not punish acts done in the mere stage of preparation. Mere preparation is punishable only when the preparation is to wage war against the Government of India (section 122), to commit depredations on the territories of any power at peace with the Government of India (section 126), or to commit dacoity (section 399).\nAttempt is the direct movement towards the commission after the preparations are made. To constitute the offence of attempt there must be an act done with the intention of committing an offence, and for the purpose of committing that offence, and it must be done in attempting the commission of the offence.\nIt is, however, not necessary to show that it is the last proximate act. It is enough if it is one in a series.\nAn attempt can only be manifested by acts which would end in the consummation of the offence, but for intervention of circumstances independent of the will of the party. An attempt is punishable even when the offence attempted cannot be committed; as when a person intending to pick another's pocket thrusts his hand into the pocket but finds it empty.\nIf the attempt to commit a crime is successful, then the crime itself is committed; but where the attempt is not followed by the intended consequences, section 511 applies.\nLeading cases:—Abhayanand.
