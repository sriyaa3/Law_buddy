## Technical Architecture

### Backend Stack
- **Framework**: FastAPI (Python 3.12)
- **Database**: SQLite (development), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Vector Store**: FAISS
- **Metadata Store**: Redis
- **Graph Database**: Neo4j
- **Document Processing**: pdfplumber, python-docx, pytesseract
- **NLP**: spaCy, transformers, sentence-transformers
- **Frontend**: React with styled-components

### SLM Implementation
- **Model**: TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0
- **Inference Engine**: Hugging Face transformers
- **Model Router**: Complexity-based routing between SLM and LLM
- **Privacy**: Local processing with sensitivity classification

### Multimodal RAG
- **Text Embeddings**: InLegalBERT fine-tuned on Indian case law
- **Image Processing**: pytesseract OCR with layout detection
- **Hybrid Retrieval**: FAISS + Redis + BM25 combination
- **Context Construction**: Relevant passages structured into context windows

## Removed Components
The following components were removed as they were not essential for the core implementation:
- Root-level legacy files (app.py, views/, templates/, static/)
- Deployment-specific files (Procfile, runtime.txt)
- Redundant test files
- Docker/Qdrant dependencies (using FAISS instead)

## Current Working State
✅ **Chat Functionality**: Working with SLM + RAG
✅ **Document Processing**: PDF/DOCX processing with entity extraction
✅ **Document Generation**: Template-based document creation
✅ **Judgment Prediction**: Case analysis with similarity search
✅ **MSME Features**: Industry taxonomy and compliance tools
✅ **API Endpoints**: All RESTful endpoints functional
✅ **Frontend Interface**: React UI with all pages implemented

## Known Limitations
⚠️ **External Services**: Redis, Neo4j, and Docker services require separate installation
⚠️ **Model Loading**: Initial model loading may take time on first run
⚠️ **Resource Usage**: SLM inference requires sufficient RAM (4GB+ recommended)

## How to Run
1. Install requirements: `pip install -r asklegal_enhanced/requirements.txt`
2. Start the application: `python asklegal_enhanced/start_app.py`
3. Access the frontend at http://localhost:8001
4. API documentation available at http://localhost:8001/docs

## Testing
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end pipeline testing
- Manual verification of chat and document features

This implementation provides a complete, working legal assistant specifically tailored for MSMEs with all the requested multimodal RAG and SLM capabilities.
